The fur appears short and smooth, typical of the breed. There is a distinct black saddle marking over its back, which is characteristic of many German Shepherds.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is medium to large in size, consistent with the breed standard. Its body is muscular and well-proportioned, with a broad chest and a strong build. The head is elongated with pointed ears that stand erect, another hallmark of the breed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's facial expression is alert and attentive, with its eyes focused forward.
