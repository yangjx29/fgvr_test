The large, upright, pointed ears are a distinctive feature of this breed.

Additionally, the robust build and facial structure, including the broad, square face and strong, muscular body, align with the breed's typical traits. The similarity scores provided by the system further support this classification, with the Norwegian Elkhound having the highest score among the candidates. | Key Features: Large, upright, pointed ears; thick, double-layered coat with gray base and darker markings; robust build; broad, square face; strong, muscular body. | Uncertainty: While the Norwegian Elkhound is the top candidate, there could be slight confusion with other breeds due to the close similarity scores.
