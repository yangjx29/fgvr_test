Its ears are floppy and hang down on either side of its head.

The texture seems smooth and slightly wrinkled, suggesting it might be made of a soft material like cotton or satin.\n\nThe furniture in the background has vertical stripes in alternating shades of blue and white, creating a striped pattern. The stripes are evenly spaced and appear to be part of a cushion or sofa backrest. The shape is curved, following the contour of the backrest, and the size is large enough to accommodate the dog comfortably.
