The puppy's predominantly white coat, dark expressive eyes, black nose, and small rounded ears are consistent with the Maltese breed. The similarity score for 'Maltese Dog' is the highest among the candidates, further supporting this classification. The puppy's overall appearance, including its size, coat texture, and facial features, strongly suggest it belongs to the Maltese breed. | Key Features: Predominantly white coat, dark expressive eyes, black nose, small rounded ears, and a compact body structure. | Uncertainty: While the puppy's appearance is very characteristic of a Maltese, there could be some overlap with other small white breeds such as Shih Tzu or Bichon Frise. However, the specific combination of features, particularly the dark eyes and the overall body structure, makes the Maltese the most likely candidate.",

The eyes are dark and expressive, with a hint of light reflecting off them, suggesting they might be a light brown or hazel color. The nose is black, which contrasts nicely with the white fur around it. The ears are small and rounded, with some light brown fur visible at the tips, indicating a possible mixed breed with a lighter coat.

There is no visible pattern other than the natural color gradient. The ears are not overly large or pointed, which suggests they may be characteristic of a breed known for having floppy ears, such as a Maltese or a Shih Tzu.

The fur appears soft and dense, giving it a plush appearance.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur is thick and appears to be slightly wavy or curly, particularly noticeable around the head and ears. There are no distinct patterns other than the natural variation in the coat's density and color.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The puppy is small in stature, with a rounded head and a short muzzle. Its body is compact and sturdy, with a relatively short back and legs that are proportionate to its overall size. The paws are small and rounded, consistent with the breed's typical build.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The puppy's facial features include large, expressive eyes and a small, black nose. The ears are soft and floppy, adding to the overall adorable appearance.
