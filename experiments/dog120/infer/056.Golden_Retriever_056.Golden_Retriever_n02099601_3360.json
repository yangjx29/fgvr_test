The texture appears soft and slightly wavy, giving them a plush appearance. The ears are medium-sized compared to the dog's head, and they have a rounded shape at the tips. There are no visible patterns or markings on the ears, making them uniform in color and texture throughout. The ears are not pointed or upright; instead, they droop naturally, which is characteristic of breeds like Golden Retrievers. This combination of size, shape, and texture helps distinguish these ears from those of other breeds with different ear structures.",

It has a rounded shape, which is typical for many breeds, particularly retrievers like Golden Retrievers. The muzzle is relatively large compared to the head, giving it a broad appearance. There are no distinct patterns or markings on the muzzle; it is uniformly colored. The nose is black and appears moist, indicating good health. The mouth is slightly open, revealing a bit of the teeth and tongue, which adds to the friendly expression of the dog. The fur around the muzzle is slightly longer and softer than the rest of the coat, creating a gentle contrast. Overall, the muzzle's features contribute to the dog's warm and approachable demeanor.",

The eyes are dark brown and have a gentle, friendly expression.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's mouth is slightly open, revealing a bit of its teeth and tongue, which adds a friendly and approachable look.
