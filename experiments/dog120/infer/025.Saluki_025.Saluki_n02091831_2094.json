The fur is smooth and shiny, indicating good health and grooming.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is fine and silky, typical of the Saluki breed, which gives it a sleek appearance. The texture is consistent across the body, with no visible shedding or mats.\n\n- **Patterns**: The white markings on the chest and muzzle create a striking contrast against the black fur. The white extends up the sides of the face, giving the dog a distinctive look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large, triangular, and stand erect, which is characteristic of the Saluki. They are slightly rounded at the tips and have a soft, silky texture. The ears are proportionate to the head and add to the dog's alert and intelligent expression.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Saluki's facial structure includes a long, narrow snout and almond-shaped eyes, which contribute to its elegant and aristocratic appearance.

The texture appears smooth and sleek, typical of breeds with short fur.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is long and narrow, with a lean and athletic build. The legs are thin and elongated, contributing to the overall slender appearance. The tail is not fully visible in the image but can be inferred to be long and thin, consistent with the breed's typical tail shape.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are long and drooping, adding to its elegant appearance. The facial features include a narrow head with a long snout, which is a hallmark of sighthound breeds. The eyes are almond-shaped and dark, giving the dog an alert and intelligent expression.\n\n- **Tail Characteristics**: While the tail isn't fully shown, it is likely to be long and tapering, as seen in many sighthound breeds.

The leash attached to the collar is also dark, matching the collar's color, and appears to be made of the same material.
