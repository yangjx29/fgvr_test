The muzzle is a lighter shade compared to the darker areas around the eyes and ears. The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, adding to its distinctive appearance.\n\nThe overall coloration of the dog is a mix of dark brown and lighter brown, with the darker tones being more prominent on the back and legs, while the lighter shades are more noticeable on the chest and lower legs. The texture of the fur appears smooth and well-groomed.\n\nThis combination of features—long ears, facial markings, and coloration—helps distinguish this dog as likely belonging to a hound breed, possibly a Bloodhound or a similar type, though without more specific information, it's difficult to pinpoint the exact breed.",

The tail is also black and appears to be medium-length. The overall body shape is that of a medium-sized hound, with a sturdy build and a slightly elongated head.
