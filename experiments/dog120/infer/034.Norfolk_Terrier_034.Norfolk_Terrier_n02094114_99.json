The fur is short and wiry, giving it a rugged appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The coat is rough and dense, typical of the Border Terrier breed, which helps in repelling water and dirt.\n\n- **Patterns**: The dog has a patchy pattern where the fur is lighter on the chest and legs, while the back and head have a darker shade. The ears are floppy and stand out due to their color contrast against the lighter fur.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small to medium-sized, standing on all fours with a compact body. Its head is elongated with a slightly rounded top, and the ears are large and hang down close to the head.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's facial expression is alert and attentive, with a slightly perked-up ear. The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to its lively demeanor. The overall build is sturdy and well-proportioned, with a strong neck and a muscular back.\n\nThese characteristics make the dog easily identifiable as a Border Terrier, distinguishing it from other breeds based",
            "The collar appears to be made of a dark-colored material, possibly leather or a synthetic equivalent, with a smooth texture. It is relatively thin and fits snugly around the dog's neck. The collar has a small, rectangular tag attached to it. The tag is metallic and has a simple design, likely with a hole for attaching to the collar. The tag's color contrasts with the collar, making it stand out. There are no visible patterns or additional embellishments on the collar or tag. The overall appearance suggests a functional and straightforward design, typical of pet collars.",

The dog appears to be a Border Terrier, characterized by its wiry, rough coat that is predominantly light brown with darker markings around the face and ears. The dog's coat has a slightly shaggy texture, giving it a rugged appearance. The dog is wearing a collar with a tag, which suggests it is a pet. The background is mostly uniform, with no other objects or people visible, emphasizing the dog as the main subject. The lighting is natural, likely from sunlight, casting soft shadows behind the dog.
