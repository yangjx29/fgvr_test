The fur is short and dense, giving it a wiry appearance typical of the breed.\n\n- **Texture**: The coat is rough and wiry, which is characteristic of Border Terriers. This texture helps protect the dog from the elements and is a key feature distinguishing them from other terrier breeds.\n\n- **Patterns**: The dog has a distinct facial pattern with darker markings around the eyes and ears, which contrast with the lighter fur on the rest of its face. The ears are small, triangular, and stand upright, another hallmark of the breed.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog’s head is relatively small compared to its body, and the ears are proportionally large in relation to the head. The overall shape of the head is elongated, which is typical for Border Terriers.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression is alert and attentive, with a slightly perked-up ear posture. The wire-like fur texture is particularly noticeable, especially around the face and legs.\n\nThese features collectively help identify the dog as a Border Terrier,",

The fur is short and dense, giving it a slightly rough texture.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur is short and wiry, which is typical for Border Terriers. There are no distinct patterns, as the coat is uniformly colored with some darker areas around the face and ears.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small to medium-sized, with a compact and muscular build. Its body is relatively short and sturdy, with a deep chest and a strong back. The tail is short and carried low, often curled over the back, which is a characteristic feature of the breed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are small, triangular, and stand upright, though they may have a slight fold at the top. The face is expressive, with a black nose and dark eyes that give it an alert and intelligent appearance. The dog's expression seems calm and attentive.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog is wearing a collar with a tag, indicating it is a pet. The overall posture suggests the dog",
            "The dog in the image has a light brown coat with a slightly shaggy texture, which is characteristic of certain terrier breeds. The fur appears to be medium-length, not too short like a smooth-coated breed, nor overly long like a wire-haired breed. The coloration is consistent throughout, with no distinct patterns or markings.\n\nIn terms of shape and size, the dog is small to medium-sized, standing on all fours with a compact body structure typical of terriers. Its ears are floppy and hang down on either side of its head, adding to its distinctive appearance. The face is broad, with a sturdy build and a slightly rounded head, which is common in terrier breeds.\n\nUnique or distinctive features include the dog's alert expression and the overall robust yet agile stance. The fur texture, combined with the dog's size and shape, helps distinguish it from breeds such as poodles or spaniels, which have different coat types and body structures.
