The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, and its nose is black. The overall size of the dog relative to the laptop suggests it is small to medium-sized.

The dog's face is round with a slightly wrinkled forehead, and its eyes are dark and expressive. The ears are floppy and hang down close to the head. The dog's nose is black, and its mouth is open, revealing a pink tongue, which suggests it might be panting.\n\nIn terms of size, the dog is positioned behind the laptop, which provides a sense of scale. The dog appears to be larger than a typical toy breed but smaller than a medium-sized breed like a Poodle or a Bichon Frise. Its body is compact and well-proportioned for its size.\n\nThe dog's coat has a consistent white color with no visible patterns or markings. The texture of the fur looks soft and slightly wavy, which is characteristic of breeds with curly coats. There are no visible signs of any unique or distinctive features such as a beard or a tail that could further narrow down the breed.
