Here's a detailed description focusing on the body shape and size:\n\n- **Color**: The Corgi has a predominantly reddish-brown coat with white markings on its chest, belly, and face. The fur appears smooth and short, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur looks soft and well-groomed, with a slight sheen that suggests good health and care.\n\n- **Patterns**: The white markings create a distinct contrast against the reddish-brown fur, particularly noticeable on the chest and face. The pattern is symmetrical and well-defined.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The Corgi has a compact, muscular build characteristic of the breed. Its body is relatively short and sturdy, with a deep chest and a strong back.

            "The tail of the dog in the image appears to be predominantly brown with some white markings, consistent with the coloration of a Corgi. It is partially obscured as the dog is mid-jump over an obstacle, but it seems to have a medium length and a slightly curved shape, typical for a Corgi's tail. The texture appears smooth, and there are no visible patterns or distinct markings on the tail itself. The tail is not prominently featured due to the angle and motion of the jump, but its position suggests it is likely tucked under the dog's body during the leap."
