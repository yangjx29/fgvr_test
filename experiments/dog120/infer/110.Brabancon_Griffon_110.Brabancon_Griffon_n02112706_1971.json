The fur appears short and smooth.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur looks soft and slightly wavy, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Patterns**: The face has a brindle pattern, with darker stripes running across the forehead and down the muzzle.

The texture appears soft and slightly wrinkled, typical of a Brabancon Griffon breed. The ears are floppy and hang down on either side of the head, covering part of the eyes and adding to the dog's expressive look. They are medium-sized compared to the head, with a rounded shape at the tips. The inner ear is darker, almost black, which contrasts with the lighter outer parts. There are no visible spots or distinct markings on the ears, making them uniform in color and pattern.
