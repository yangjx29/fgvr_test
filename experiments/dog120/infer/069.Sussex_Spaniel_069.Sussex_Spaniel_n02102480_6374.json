The rich, dark brown coat with a slightly wavy texture is typical of this breed.

The overall body structure and coat quality further support this identification. While the similarity scores suggest some overlap with other breeds like the Kerry Blue Terrier, the distinct features such as the coat texture and facial structure make the Irish Water Spaniel the most accurate match. | Key Features: Rich, dark brown coat with a slightly wavy texture, medium-sized sturdy build, floppy ears, and slightly open mouth with a pink tongue. | Uncertainty: The similarity scores to other breeds like the Kerry Blue Terrier are relatively close, but the distinct coat texture and facial structure provide strong evidence for the Irish Water Spaniel.",

The overall coloration is uniform, with no visible patterns or markings other than the natural variation in the coat's texture. The dog's face is medium-sized in proportion to its body, and its facial features are well-defined, contributing to a friendly and approachable demeanor.

Its ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to its distinctive appearance. The tail is short and slightly curved upwards.\n\nUnique features include the dog's expressive eyes and the slightly open mouth, giving it a friendly expression. The overall body structure is compact and balanced, with a strong, muscular build. There are no visible variations or special characteristics that stand out as unique to this particular dog compared to other similar breeds.",

The tail is relatively thick at the base and gradually narrows as it extends towards the tip. This shape and size are typical for many breeds, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific breed without additional context. However, the overall appearance suggests a well-groomed and healthy dog."
