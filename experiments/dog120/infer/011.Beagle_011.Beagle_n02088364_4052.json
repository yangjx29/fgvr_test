The tricolor coat pattern (black, white, and tan), the long floppy ears, the compact body, and the facial markings are all characteristic of a beagle.

These scores further support the classification of the image as a beagle. | Key Features: Tricolor coat pattern, long floppy ears, compact body, facial markings, and the overall appearance consistent with a beagle puppy. | Uncertainty: There is no significant uncertainty in the classification due to the clear visual evidence and high similarity scores. However, the slight overlap in scores between Beagle and Basset Hound could introduce a minor level of uncertainty, but the distinct facial and body features of the puppy in the image strongly favor the Beagle classification.",

The face is marked with tan or light brown around the eyes, cheeks, and muzzle, creating a tricolor pattern. The fur appears soft and slightly fluffy, typical of beagles.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are long, floppy, and hang down on either side of the head. They are large in proportion to the puppy's head and have a rounded shape at the tips. The ears are covered with the same tan or light brown color as the face markings, contrasting with the black fur on the rest of the body.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The puppy's face is expressive, with dark, round eyes that give it an alert and curious look. The white fur around the mouth and nose area creates a contrast against the darker fur, making these features stand out. The overall proportions of the puppy suggest it is still young, with a small, compact body and short legs.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The puppy's coat has a smooth texture, and there are no visible signs of any special markings or patterns beyond the tr",
