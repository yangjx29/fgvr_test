The texture seems coarse and wiry, which is typical for Otterhounds, providing them with a weather-resistant coat.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a long, low-slung body with a deep chest and a muscular build. Its head is large and broad, with a flat top and a slightly wrinkled forehead. The ears are long and droopy, hanging down close to the shoulders. The tail is long and bushy, often carried low when at rest.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Otterhound's most distinctive feature is its long, shaggy beard and whiskers, which give it a unique facial appearance. Additionally, the dog's legs are relatively short compared to its body length, contributing to its sturdy and robust look.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: Otterhounds are known for their versatility and adaptability, often excelling in water sports due to their strong swimming ability. Their coat is not only functional but also serves as a natural waterproofing layer, making them well-suited",

Its ears are long and droopy, hanging down close to the sides of its head. The tail is bushy and curled over the back, adding to the dog's overall robust look.\n\nUnique features include the dog's alert expression and the characteristic facial markings, such as the darker fur around the eyes and muzzle, which contrast with the lighter areas.
