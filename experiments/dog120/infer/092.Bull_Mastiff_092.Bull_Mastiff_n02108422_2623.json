Its fur is a tan color with black markings, and the texture seems slightly rougher than the Boxer's. The ears are tall and erect, standing upright, which is a hallmark of the German Shepherd breed.

The coat is medium-length and has a distinct pattern where the tan coloration is concentrated around the chest, legs, and face.\n\n### Shape and Size:\n- **Boxer**: The Boxer has a robust, square-shaped body with a broad chest and a shorter muzzle.

The texture of the fur is smooth and short.\n\nThe dog on the right is a German Shepherd, identifiable by its elongated snout, pointed ears, and a more angular facial structure. Its snout is longer than that of the Boxer, and it has a black nose. The eyes are also almond-shaped but appear smaller due to the larger size of the face.

The Boxer's facial features are more rounded and compact, while the German Shepherd's are more elongated and defined.
