The nose is a darker shade of brown, possibly black, and is small and rounded. The ears are pointed and stand upright, indicating attentiveness.

Here's a detailed description focusing on the dog's body shape and size:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a light brown coat with a smooth texture. There are no visible patterns or markings on the visible part of its body.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog appears to be medium-sized, with a lean yet muscular build. Its body is elongated, typical of many working or hunting breeds. The dog's head is proportionate to its body, with a broad forehead and pointed ears that stand upright.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are particularly distinctive, being tall and erect, which could suggest it belongs to a breed known for such ear structure, like a Podenco or a similar breed.\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog looks alert and relaxed, with its mouth slightly open, possibly panting. The overall posture suggests it is comfortable in its environment.\n\nThese characteristics help distinguish the dog from other breeds based on its physical attributes.",
