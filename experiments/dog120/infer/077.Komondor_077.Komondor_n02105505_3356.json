            "The image shows a Komondor dog lying on a wooden floor. The fur texture is distinctive for Komondor dogs, characterized by its thick, corded appearance. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The fur is predominantly white, with some light beige or cream tones visible in certain areas, particularly around the face and legs. The cords are a uniform off-white color.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur is thick and dense, forming distinct cords or ropes that give the dog a unique, mop-like appearance. These cords are tightly packed and have a slightly rough texture, which is typical of the breed's protective coat. The cords are irregularly shaped and vary in thickness, creating a natural, organic pattern across the dog's body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The cords are large and substantial, covering most of the dog's body. They form a fluffy, rounded shape that contrasts with the sleeker, more groomed coats of other breeds. The cords are not uniform in length; some are longer and more prominent than others, adding to the textured look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The cords are the defining feature of the Komondor breed. They are not only thick but also have a natural sheen, which is enhanced by the lighting in",

The coloration is uniform across the body.\n\n- **Texture**: The coat is thick, dense, and corded, forming long, rope-like strands that hang down from the body. This texture is unique to the Komondor breed and is a result of their natural shedding pattern.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a large, muscular build with a broad chest and a sturdy frame. Its head is relatively small compared to its body, with a flat face and a slightly elongated snout. The ears are small and set high on the head, blending into the corded fur.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the corded coat, which is not only thick but also forms distinct cords that give the dog a lion-like appearance. The cords are not just on the back but also cover the entire body, including the legs and tail.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, and they are partially obscured by the long fur around them.
