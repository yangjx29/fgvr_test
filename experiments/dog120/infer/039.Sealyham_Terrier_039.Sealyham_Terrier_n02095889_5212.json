            "The dog in the image has a predominantly white coat with some light brown or tan markings around the ears and on the back of the head. The fur appears slightly wavy and somewhat unkempt, giving it a natural, untrimmed look. \n\n- **Color**: The primary color is white, with subtle brownish tones on the ears and back of the head. \n- **Texture**: The fur is soft and appears slightly wavy, not overly smooth or silky.\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large and floppy, hanging down close to the sides of the head. They have a rounded shape at the tips and are proportionally large compared to the head.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes are partially obscured by the long, wavy fur, making them less visible. However, they appear dark and expressive. The ears are a distinctive feature, being large and droopy, which can be characteristic of certain breeds like the Sealyham Terrier or a similar breed.\n\nThese features, especially the large floppy ears and the overall facial structure, suggest the dog might belong to a breed known for such characteristics.",
            "The dog in the image appears to be a small breed with a compact and sturdy build. Here are the visual characteristics that help distinguish it:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly white coat with some light brown or tan markings on the ears and around the eyes, giving it a slightly brindle-like pattern. The fur is thick and somewhat shaggy, especially around the face and neck.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is fluffy and appears soft to the touch, with a slightly wavy texture. It looks well-groomed but not overly smooth.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is relatively small and compact, with a short, sturdy build. The head is proportionate to the body, with a slightly rounded forehead and a medium-sized muzzle. The ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to the overall fluffy appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog has a black nose and dark eyes, which stand out against the lighter fur. The expression seems calm and friendly. The collar is black and appears to be made of a woven material, possibly leather or a similar durable fabric.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's coat is quite long and thick, which could make it prone to matting if not regularly groomed.",
