Here's a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a rich, reddish-brown coat with a slightly rough texture, which is typical for Norfolk Terriers. The fur appears dense and well-groomed.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The coat has a wiry texture, which is a hallmark of Norfolk Terriers. There are no distinct patterns visible; the fur is uniformly colored across the body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small to medium-sized, with a compact and muscular build. Its head is broad and square, with a short muzzle and a black nose. The ears are small, triangular, and stand upright, which is characteristic of the breed.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, giving it an alert and intelligent appearance. The tail is short and often carried curled over the back, though it may not be fully visible in this image.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: Norfolk Terriers typically have a double coat, with a harsh outer layer and a softer undercoat. This gives them a distinctive look. The dog in the image does not show",
