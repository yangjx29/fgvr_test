Here's a detailed description focusing on the face and ears:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The Basset Hound has a predominantly light brown coat with white markings. The fur appears soft and slightly wavy, typical of the breed. The white markings are particularly noticeable on the chest, belly, and the tip of the tail.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large, floppy, and hang down close to the ground, a hallmark of the Basset Hound. They are proportionally large compared to the head, which is another distinguishing feature. The ears are not as wide as those of a Great Dane but are still quite prominent.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Basset Hound's face is long and narrow, with a slightly wrinkled forehead and a short muzzle. The eyes are dark and expressive, often giving the impression of being sad or gentle. The nose is typically black, adding contrast to the lighter fur around it.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: Basset Hounds have a distinctive \"bat-eared\" appearance, with the ears",
