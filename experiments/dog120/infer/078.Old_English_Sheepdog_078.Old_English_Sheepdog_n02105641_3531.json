The fur appears thick and fluffy, giving it a soft and woolly appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is very dense and curly, creating a shaggy look. This texture is particularly noticeable around the face, where the fur is longer and more pronounced.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are no distinct patterns on the face itself; however, the darker fur around the eyes and ears contrasts with the lighter, predominantly white fur on the rest of the face.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The face is large and round, typical of the breed.

The fur around the ears is thick and extends down to cover part of the face, giving the dog a somewhat shaggy appearance. The ears are positioned low on the head, hanging down close to the sides of the face. They are not pointed but rather rounded at the tips, which adds to the dog's overall gentle and friendly look. The color of the fur is predominantly white, with some darker areas near the base of the ears, possibly indicating a mix of colors or natural variation in the coat. There are no visible patterns or distinct markings on the ears themselves, making them appear uniform in color and texture.

The dog's fur is thick and curly, giving it a shaggy appearance. Its face is large and expressive, with a black nose and a pink tongue that is partially visible as the dog seems to be panting. The ears are not fully visible due to the dense fur covering them.\n\nThe dog's body is medium-sized, with a sturdy build. The fur on the chest and belly is particularly fluffy and white, contrasting with the slightly darker fur on the back and sides. The overall shape of the dog is rounded and robust, typical of breeds like Old English Sheepdogs or similar fluffy breeds.\n\nUnique features include the dog's wide, open mouth and the distinct contrast between the white fur and the darker patches around the mouth. The texture of the fur is soft and appears slightly tousled, adding to the dog's endearing and somewhat unkempt look.
