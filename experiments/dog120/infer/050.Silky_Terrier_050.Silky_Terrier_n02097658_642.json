The mouth is slightly open, revealing a pink tongue, giving it a friendly expression. The overall head shape is compact and rounded at the top.\n\nThe dog's body is covered in a mix of light and dark fur. The back and sides have a darker, almost grayish-brown coat, while the chest and legs are lighter, maintaining the same wavy texture as the head. The tail is short and slightly curved upwards, blending into the darker fur of the back. The dog's posture is alert and attentive, standing on a gravel surface.

The lighter brown fur covers most of its face, chest, and legs, while the gray fur is more prominent on its back and sides. The coloration gives it a warm, earthy appearance.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur appears short and slightly wiry, which is typical for breeds like the Yorkshire Terrier or Silky Terrier. There are no distinct patterns, as the fur is uniformly colored across the body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small in stature, with a well-proportioned body. Its head is relatively large compared to its body, with a broad forehead and pointed ears. The legs are short and sturdy, supporting the dog's compact frame. The overall shape is square, with a balanced and muscular build.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's ears are upright and pointed, adding to its alert and attentive expression. Its tail is short and slightly curved upwards, which is characteristic of many terrier breeds. The dog's coat looks well-groomed, with a slight sheen that suggests good health and care.\n\n-",
