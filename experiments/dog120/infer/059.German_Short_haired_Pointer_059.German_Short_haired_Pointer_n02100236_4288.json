The ears are floppy and slightly rounded at the tips, adding to the characteristic look of the breed. The dog's eyes are not clearly visible due to the angle, but they appear to be dark in color. The overall shape of the head is broad and square, typical of many hunting breeds. There are no visible unique markings or spots on the head itself, which helps in distinguishing it from other breeds that might have more pronounced facial patterns.",

The texture appears smooth, and the spots are irregularly shaped, varying in size across the body. The dog's back is predominantly dark brown, while the sides and legs have a lighter speckled pattern. The tail is white with some darker markings near the base. The overall body shape is medium-sized and muscular, typical of a hunting breed. The dog's ears are floppy and dark brown, and it wears an orange collar around its neck. The background consists of tall green grass, which partially obscures the lower part of the dog's body.",
            "The tail of the dog in the image is predominantly white with some light brown markings, matching the coat pattern. It appears to have a slightly curved shape, not overly long but full enough to be noticeable. The texture seems smooth, typical of a healthy dog's tail. There are no distinctive features such as tufts or curls at the end; it maintains a consistent width throughout its length. The tail's length is moderate, neither too short nor excessively long for the breed, suggesting it could belong to a medium-sized dog. The white coloration contrasts with the darker spots on the rest of the body, making it stand out against the green grassy background."
