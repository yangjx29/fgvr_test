The black and white dog on the left exhibits the classic Boston Terrier-like appearance, but the tan dog on the right clearly displays the typical French Bulldog traits such as the compact body, short muzzle, and floppy ears. The similarity score for French Bulldog is slightly higher than other candidates, indicating a strong match. The consistent visual evidence supports the classification. | Key Features: Compact body, short muzzle, floppy ears, and uniform tan coat are key features of the French Bulldog, which are evident in the tan dog on the right. | Uncertainty: The black and white dog's features suggest it could be a Boston Terrier, but the tan dog's features are unmistakably those of a French Bulldog.
