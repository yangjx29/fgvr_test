The face is marked by a white blaze running down the center, flanked by two large, dark brown patches that extend from the eyes to the sides of the muzzle. These patches are bordered by a thin white line, creating a mask-like appearance. The dog's ears are short and stand upright, adding to its alert expression.\n\nThe head is relatively small compared to the body, which is typical for many dog breeds. The eyes are dark and expressive, contributing to the dog's attentive demeanor. The overall pattern and coloration are consistent with the Entlebucher Sennenhund breed, known for their distinctive tricolor coat (black, tan, and white).

The black fur appears smooth and dense.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur looks thick and well-groomed, typical of the Appenzeller Sennenhund breed, which is known for its sturdy build and protective coat.\n\n- **Patterns**: The coat pattern includes a symmetrical distribution of colors, with the black forming the base color and the tan and white creating contrast. The tan markings are particularly noticeable on the legs and face, while the white is prominent on the chest and paws.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog appears medium-sized, with a sturdy build and a broad head. Its ears are triangular and stand erect, contributing to its alert appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's facial expression is attentive, with a slightly open mouth showing its teeth, which is common in working dogs like the Appenzeller Sennenhund. The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to its alert demeanor.\n\n- **",
