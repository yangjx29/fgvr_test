The dogs appear to be Yorkshire Terriers (Yorkies), characterized by their compact body shape and short fur.\n\n- **Color**: The Yorkies have a rich, golden-brown coat with darker markings around their eyes and ears, which is typical for the breed. Their fur appears smooth and well-groomed.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks soft and shiny, indicating good health and care.\n- **Shape and Size**: Both dogs are small and compact, fitting comfortably on the person's lap. They have a rounded head with large, expressive eyes and pointed ears that stand upright.\n- **Unique Features**: The Yorkies' faces are endearing, with a slightly wrinkled forehead and a small, black nose. Their bodies are slender yet sturdy, with a short, muscular build.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The dogs are closely positioned, suggesting affection and comfort.
