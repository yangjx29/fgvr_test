Additionally, the dog's confident and alert expression, along with its sturdy build, are also indicative of the Kerry Blue Terrier.

The fur is medium-length, covering the entire body evenly. \n\n**Face:**\n- **Eyes:** The eyes are dark and expressive, with a slightly alert expression. They are almond-shaped and set deep within the head, contributing to the dog's intelligent and watchful demeanor.\n- **Ears:** The ears are triangular and stand erect, adding to the terrier's alert and attentive posture. They are not floppy but have a slight curve at the tips.\n\n**Distinctive Features:**\n- The Kerry Blue Terrier's face is relatively small compared to its body, which is typical for terriers. This compact facial structure complements the dog's sturdy build.\n- The overall expression is one of confidence and alertness, with a slightly perked-up nose and mouth that suggest a friendly yet independent nature.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the Kerry Blue Terrier from other breeds, making it easily identifiable by its unique combination of color, texture, and facial structure.",
            "The dog in the image appears to be a Bouvier des Flandres, characterized by its robust and muscular build. Here's a detailed description focusing on the body structure:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a dark, almost black coat with a slightly rough and wiry texture. This is typical for the breed, which often has a dense, water-repellent coat.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is thick and dense, giving the dog a sturdy appearance. The texture is not smooth but rather coarse, which is beneficial for herding and working purposes.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a square-shaped body with a broad chest and strong, well-developed muscles. Its legs are relatively short compared to its body, contributing to its sturdy and balanced look. The paws are large and round, which is characteristic of the breed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Bouvier des Flandres typically has a distinctive head shape with a broad skull, a short muzzle, and a beard and mustache. The ears are triangular and stand erect, though they may droop slightly when relaxed. The tail is usually docked and carried low.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's overall build suggests strength and endurance, making it well-suited for herding tasks",
            "The tail of the dog in the image is not visible, as it appears to be tucked between the legs. This positioning suggests that the tail might be short or possibly docked, which is common for certain breeds like the Bouvier des Flandres. Given the breed's typical physical characteristics, the tail could be:\n\n- **Color**: Likely black, matching the rest of the dog's coat.\n- **Texture**: Smooth and dense, consistent with the Bouvier des Flandres' thick, water-repellent coat.\n- **Shape and Size**: Short and sturdy, possibly ending in a slight curve or point, though the exact shape cannot be determined due to the angle and position.\n- **Unique Features**: The tail may have a slight tuft at the end, which is sometimes seen in Bouviers, adding a distinctive touch.\n\nWithout seeing the tail, these are educated guesses based on the breed's general appearance. If the tail were visible, it would provide more definitive clues about the breed."
