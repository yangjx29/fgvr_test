The eyes are partially closed, giving it a relaxed or tired expression. The ears are not visible in the image, suggesting they may be floppy or tucked close to the head.\n\nThe dog's overall appearance, including its size and facial structure, aligns with the physical traits commonly associated with the Tibetan Mastiff breed. The thick fur and broad head are particularly indicative of this breed.",

The black fur is dense and appears slightly wavy, while the white fur is lighter and more uniform. The texture of the fur looks coarse and robust, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is large in size, which is consistent with the Tibetan Mastiff breed. Its head is broad and square, with a short muzzle and a strong jawline. The ears are small and set high on the head, often folded over at the tips.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, and they are partially covered by the fur around them, giving it a somewhat serious expression. The dog's nose is black and prominent, and its mouth is slightly open, revealing a pink tongue.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's overall build is muscular and powerful, with a broad chest and a sturdy frame. The tail is not visible in the image, but Tibetan Mastiffs typically have a thick, curled tail that is carried low when relaxed.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the dog as a Tibetan Mastiff, a breed",
