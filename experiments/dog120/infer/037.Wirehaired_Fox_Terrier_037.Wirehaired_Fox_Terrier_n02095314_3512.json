The fur is long and slightly wavy, giving it a soft and fluffy appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is thick and dense, especially around the body, which adds to the dog's overall fluffy look. The ears are covered in longer, more abundant fur, which hangs down close to the head.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large and drop down to the sides of the head, framing the face. They are proportionally large compared to the rest of the head, contributing to the dog's distinctive look.\n\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - The face is relatively small and compact, with a slightly rounded shape.\n  - The eyes are dark and expressive, set within a gentle curve of the face.\n  - The muzzle is short and sturdy, with a slight beard-like growth of hair under the chin.\n  - The ears are large and floppy, with a noticeable amount of fur that covers them completely.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The Sealyham Terrier is known for its friendly and affectionate nature, which is reflected",
            "The image depicts a Sealyham Terrier, a breed known for its distinctive body structure and unique appearance. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The Sealyham Terrier in the image has a predominantly white coat with light brown markings on the legs and paws. The fur appears soft and slightly wavy, giving it a silky texture.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The coat is thick and dense, especially around the body, which contributes to the dog's robust appearance. The hair is longer on the head, ears, and legs, creating a fluffy look, while the body remains shorter and more compact.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The Sealyham Terrier has a sturdy, muscular build with a broad chest and a deep, square-shaped muzzle. The body is slightly longer than tall, with a strong, well-defined back and a level topline. The legs are short and sturdy, supporting the dog's weight effectively.\n\n- **Unique Features**: One of the most distinctive features of the Sealyham Terrier is its beard-like growth of hair around the mouth and chin, which gives the dog a somewhat distinguished look. The ears are small, triangular, and set high on the head, often folded over at the tips. The tail is dock",
            "The dog in the image has a predominantly white coat with some light brown markings on the legs. The texture appears soft and slightly wavy, typical of certain breeds known for their long, flowing fur. \n\n- **Tail**: The tail is short and appears to be docked, which is a common practice in some breeds like the Sealyham Terrier. It is covered in the same soft, wavy fur as the rest of the body.\n\n- **Legs**: The front legs are relatively short and sturdy, supporting the dog's stance. The back legs are also short but appear slightly longer than the front ones, contributing to an overall balanced look. The fur on the legs is slightly longer and more abundant compared to the body, giving them a fluffy appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's face is not fully visible due to the angle, but the visible part shows a well-defined muzzle and a small, pointed nose. The ears are not prominently visible, suggesting they may be folded down close to the head.\n\nThese characteristics, particularly the short legs, docked tail, and soft, wavy fur, suggest that the dog could be a Sealyham Terrier or a similar breed.
