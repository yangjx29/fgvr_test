There are no visible patterns other than the natural coloration mentioned above.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small in stature, standing on all fours with a compact body. Its head is elongated with a slightly pointed muzzle, and its ears are long and hang down close to the sides of its head.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's most notable feature is its long, flowing hair that covers much of its body, especially around the legs and chest. This gives it a somewhat bird-like appearance, particularly when viewed from certain angles. The hair also appears to be slightly longer on the back and shorter towards the legs, creating a layered effect.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The dog's overall appearance suggests it might be a breed known for its long, flowing hair, such as a Sealyham Terrier or a Dandie Dinmont Terrier.",
