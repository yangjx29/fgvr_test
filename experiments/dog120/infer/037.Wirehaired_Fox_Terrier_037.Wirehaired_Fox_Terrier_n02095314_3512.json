The long, hanging ears and the overall fluffy appearance further support this identification. The similarity scores provided by the system also indicate that the Sealyham Terrier is the closest match among the given options. | Key Features: Compact and sturdy build, thick and dense coat, broad and flat skull, elongated snout, long hanging ears, and a fluffy appearance. | Uncertainty: While the Sealyham Terrier is clearly the best match based on the visual evidence and similarity scores, there could be slight confusion with other breeds like the Keeshond due to their similar fluffy coats and facial structures.
