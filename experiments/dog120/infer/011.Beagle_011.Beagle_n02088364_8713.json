The body has a combination of white and brown patches, with some darker areas on the back and legs.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur appears soft and slightly wavy, typical of beagles. It looks well-groomed, indicating good care.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is compact and sturdy, with a medium build. Its head is large in proportion to its body, with a broad skull and long, floppy ears. The ears are a distinctive feature, hanging down close to the sides of the head.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The beagle's most notable features include its expressive eyes, which are often described as \"sad\" due to their shape and expression.
