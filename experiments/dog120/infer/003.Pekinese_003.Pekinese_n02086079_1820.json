Its fur is short and smooth, with a rich golden-brown color on the top of the head and ears, transitioning to a lighter, almost cream-colored hue around the muzzle and chest. The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, and it has a black nose. Around its neck, the dog wears a bright green bandana with a pattern that includes white text, adding a playful touch to its appearance.\n\nThe dog's size appears relatively small compared to adult dogs, consistent with toy breeds like Pekingese or Shih Tzu. Its ears are soft and floppy, framing its face nicely. The overall body structure is compact and sturdy, with a short back and a slightly rounded belly, which is characteristic of these breeds. The dog's expression is calm and attentive, giving it an endearing and friendly demeanor.",

The face is predominantly light brown with a white patch around the mouth and chin, creating a contrast. The eyes are dark and expressive, framed by the fur. The ears are medium-sized, floppy, and covered with the same light brown fur as the rest of the head.\n\nThe dog's bandana is bright green with a pattern that includes white text and designs, adding a pop of color against the fur. The bandana is tied neatly around the neck, covering part of the chest area. The overall size of the dog is small, typical for a Pekingese breed, which is consistent with the compact and sturdy build visible in the image.
