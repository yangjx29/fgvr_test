The large, triangular, upright ears, the black coat with reddish-brown markings around the eyes and muzzle, and the overall facial structure are characteristic of the Miniature Pinscher.

The fur appears smooth and short.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks sleek and well-groomed, without any visible shedding or mats.\n- **Patterns**: There is a distinct pattern of reddish-brown markings that form a mask-like appearance around the eyes and a stripe down the center of the nose.
