Its head is large in proportion to its body, with a rounded face and prominent ears that hang down close to the sides of its head.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's most noticeable feature is its long, floppy ears and the way its tongue is sticking out, suggesting it might be panting or happy. The overall shape of the dog is compact and sturdy, typical of breeds like Old English Sheepdogs or similar fluffy breeds.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The dog's coat seems to have a natural wave or curl, adding to its unique look.
