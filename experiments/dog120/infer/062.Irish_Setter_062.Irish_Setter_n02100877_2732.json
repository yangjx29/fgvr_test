The head is elongated with a slightly arched forehead, and the ears are long and floppy, hanging down close to the shoulders.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes are almond-shaped and expressive, with a warm, friendly gaze. The nose is black, and the mouth is closed, showing no signs of drooling or panting. The tail is long and feathered, curling over the back.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: Irish Setters often have a white blaze on their chest and sometimes on their muzzle, but this particular dog does not display any such markings",
