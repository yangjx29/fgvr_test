The dog's fur looks smooth and shiny, indicating good health and grooming. There are no visible patterns other than the white marking on its face.

The texture appears to be soft and slightly ribbed, typical of wool or a similar material. The socks are snugly fitted around the feet, indicating they are likely made for comfort and warmth. The legs are positioned in a relaxed manner, with one leg slightly bent at the knee, resting on what seems to be a plaid blanket. The overall size of the socks is proportional to the feet, suggesting they are appropriately sized.
