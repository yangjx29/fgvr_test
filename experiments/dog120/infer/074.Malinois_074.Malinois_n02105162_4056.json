The thick, dense, wavy coat with a mix of light and dark brown fur, the broad head with a strong jawline, the upright triangular ears, and the overall body structure all align with the Tervuren breed. The similarity scores provided also indicate a high likelihood of this being a Tervuren, with the Groenendael being the closest but with a lower score. | Key Features: Thick, dense, wavy coat; broad head with strong jawline; upright triangular ears; shaggy fur around the neck and chest. | Uncertainty: While the Tervuren is highly likely based on the visual evidence, there could be slight confusion with the Groenendael due to their similar coat texture and coloration.
