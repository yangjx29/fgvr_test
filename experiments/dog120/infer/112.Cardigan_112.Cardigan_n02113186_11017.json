The face is marked by a white stripe running down the center, flanked by brown fur on either side. The ears are pointed and stand upright, showing a mix of brown and white.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur appears smooth and short, typical of a corgi breed. The white markings contrast sharply with the reddish-brown, creating a clear pattern.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of corgis. The eyes are dark and expressive, and the snout is short and wide.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are erect and alert, indicating attentiveness. The white stripe on the face is a common feature in corgis, particularly in the Pembroke Welsh Corgi variety.

Its head is small in proportion to its body, with large, pointed ears that stand upright. The overall size suggests it is an adult dog, likely medium-sized for the Pembroke Welsh Corgi breed.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's facial expression, with its slightly open mouth and alert eyes, gives it a friendly and curious demeanor.
