The ears are small, pointed, and stand upright. The dog's eyes are dark and expressive.\n\nThe second dog, standing behind the first, has a larger build and a different coat texture. It appears to be a Bouvier des Flandres. This dog's face is predominantly black with some white markings on the chest and paws. The fur is thick and coarse, giving it a shaggy appearance.

The smaller dog's white markings and softer texture make it stand out, while the larger dog's darker, denser coat gives it a more robust appearance.
