There are also small yellow flowers scattered throughout, adding a touch of color contrast.\n   - **Trees**: The trees have a mix of light and dark brown bark, with some showing signs of peeling or rough texture. The leaves are sparse, suggesting it might be late autumn or early spring.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**:\n   - **Trees**: The trees vary in size; some are taller and more prominent, while others are smaller and closer to the foreground. Their shapes are irregular, typical of natural growth.\n   - **Grass**: The grass forms a flat surface with slight undulations, creating a natural, organic pattern.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - **Tree Trunks**: The tree trunks are thick and sturdy, with visible rings indicating age.
