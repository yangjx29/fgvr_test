There are no distinct patterns or markings on the face, as the fur is short and even.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is small in proportion to the body, with a narrow skull and a slightly elongated snout. The ears are small and set high on the head, often folded back against the head or close to the skull.\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - The eyes are almond-shaped and dark, giving the dog an alert and intelligent expression.\n  - The nose is small and dark, possibly black or a very dark brown.\n  - The mouth is closed, and there are no visible teeth or whiskers.\n- **Distinctive Characteristics**: The overall shape of the head is elongated and narrow, typical of sighthounds, which are designed for speed and agility.\n\nThese features help distinguish the dog from other breeds, particularly those with more rounded heads or different coat textures.",

There are no distinct patterns or markings, giving it a uniform appearance across its body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is tall and lean, with long legs and a narrow waist. Its body is streamlined, which is characteristic of breeds designed for speed and agility. The head is small in proportion to the body, with a narrow muzzle and erect ears.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's posture is notable; it is sitting upright with its front legs extended forward, possibly in a playful or alert stance. This posture highlights its long limbs and lean build. The tail appears short and tucked between the hind legs.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The dog's coat seems to be short-haired, which is common for sighthounds.
