The coat pattern, with a dark brown body and white markings on the chest, muzzle, and around the eyes, is typical of this breed. The floppy ears, expressive eyes, and the overall facial structure further support this identification. The similarity scores provided also indicate a high likelihood of this being an English Springer Spaniel, with the highest score being 0.3439 compared to other breeds. | Key Features: The coat pattern, facial features, and overall expression are consistent with those of an English Springer Spaniel. The white blaze on the chest and muzzle, along with the floppy ears and expressive eyes, are key identifying features. | Uncertainty: While the image strongly suggests an English Springer Spaniel, there could be slight variations in coat patterns or facial expressions that might lead to a lower confidence level if seen in isolation.
