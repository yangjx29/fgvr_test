The curls are tightly coiled, creating a fluffy appearance.\n- **Patterns**: There are no visible patterns or markings on the dog's coat; it is solid black throughout.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a medium build with a broad head and a slightly elongated body. Its ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to its expressive face.\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the curly coat, which is unique to the Curly-Coated Retriever breed. This texture not only provides insulation but also makes the dog appear more robust and friendly.\n- **Expression**: The dog's expression is calm and alert. Its eyes are dark and round, and the overall demeanor suggests intelligence and attentiveness.\n\nThese characteristics make the Curly-Coated Retriever easily distinguishable from other breeds, particularly those with smoother coats or different facial structures."
