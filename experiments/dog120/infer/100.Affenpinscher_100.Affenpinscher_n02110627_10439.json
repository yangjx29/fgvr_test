There are no distinct patterns other than the natural coloration and the white markings.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is relatively small and compact. Its head is large in proportion to its body, with a broad forehead and a short muzzle. The ears are small and stand upright, adding to the overall compactness of the dog's head.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's facial features include a wide, expressive face with dark eyes and a small, open mouth showing its tongue.
