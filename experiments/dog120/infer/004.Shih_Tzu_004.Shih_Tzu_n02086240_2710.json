Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly gray coat with some darker and lighter shades, giving it a slightly mottled appearance. There is also a hint of white on its chest and paws, which contrasts with the gray.\n- **Texture**: The fur appears thick and somewhat shaggy, especially around the head and back, suggesting a double coat typical of breeds like Shih Tzus or Affenpinschers.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small in stature, with a rounded head and a short muzzle. Its body is compact and well-proportioned, with a sturdy build. The legs are short and strong, supporting the dog's weight effectively.\n- **Unique Features**: A distinctive feature is the pink flower accessory adorning the dog's head, adding a playful and decorative element.
