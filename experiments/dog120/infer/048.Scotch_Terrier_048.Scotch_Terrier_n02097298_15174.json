The dog on the right displays the characteristic traits of a Labrador Retriever, such as its smooth, shiny black coat, larger and more rounded head, floppy ears, and broader snout. These features align perfectly with the descriptions provided in the structured description. The similarity scores for other breeds are much lower, further supporting the accuracy of the classification. | Key Features: The Scottish Terrier's dark gray, wiry coat with a rough texture, small rounded head, pointed erect ears, and 'mustache' pattern; the Labrador Retriever's smooth, shiny black coat, larger and more rounded head, floppy ears, and broader snout. | Uncertainty: There are no significant uncertainty factors affecting the classification.

The eyes are dark and expressive, typical of the breed.\n\nThese distinctive features help differentiate the two breeds: the Scottish Terrier's wiry coat and pointed ears versus the Labrador Retriever's smooth coat and floppy ears.",
            "The image shows two dogs lying on grass. The dog on the left appears to be a Scottish Terrier, characterized by its wiry, black coat with a rough texture and a distinctive beard-like growth around its mouth. Its head is relatively small compared to its body, with pointed ears that stand upright. The neck is short and thick, typical of the breed's sturdy build.\n\nThe dog on the right is a Labrador Retriever, recognizable by its smooth, shiny black coat. Its head is proportionally larger than the Scottish Terrier's, with a broad forehead and a slightly longer snout. The neck is also thicker and more muscular, consistent with the Labrador's robust physique. The Labrador's ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, contrasting with the Scottish Terrier's erect ears.\n\nBoth dogs have a similar coloration—black—but their coats differ in texture and length. The Scottish Terrier's coat is rough and wiry, while the Labrador's is smooth and glossy. The Scottish Terrier's head and neck are smaller and more compact, whereas the Labrador's head and neck are larger and more pronounced. These differences in body shape and size, along with the unique features of each breed, help distinguish them from one another.",

The dog's face has a rounded shape with a slightly wrinkled forehead, and its ears are erect and pointed.\n\nThe dog on the right is a Labrador Retriever, recognizable by its smooth, shiny black coat. The fur is sleek and appears to have a softer texture compared to the Scottish Terrier. The Labrador's face is more elongated, with a broad head and floppy ears. Its mouth is open, revealing a pink tongue, which contrasts with the black fur.\n\nBoth dogs share a similar black coloration, but their fur textures and patterns differ significantly. The Scottish Terrier's fur is rough and wiry, while the Labrador's fur is smooth and glossy. The Scottish Terrier's coat is more rugged and stands out due to its texture, whereas the Labrador's coat is sleek and blends more seamlessly with its body.
