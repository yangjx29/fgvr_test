The light-colored coat with a mix of white and light brown fur, the fluffy and tousled coat, the compact and sturdy body shape, and the friendly expression are all consistent with this breed.

While the similarity scores suggest other breeds like the Otterhound and Kuvasz could also be considered, the visual evidence strongly aligns with the Soft-coated Wheaten Terrier. | Key Features: ['Light-colored coat with a mix of white and light brown fur', 'Fluffy and tousled coat', 'Compact and sturdy body shape', 'Long, floppy ears', 'Friendly expression'] | Uncertainty: ['The similarity scores to other breeds are relatively close, making it challenging to definitively rule out other possibilities.']",

            "The dog in the image appears to be a small breed with a compact and sturdy build. Here are the visual characteristics that help distinguish it:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a light beige or cream-colored coat with darker patches, particularly around the ears and back. The fur looks slightly matted and dirty, suggesting recent activity in a natural environment.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur is thick and somewhat shaggy, giving it a fluffy appearance. There are visible dark spots and patches, possibly mud or dirt, which add to the rugged look. The texture seems soft but not overly smooth.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is relatively small and compact. It has a broad head with a short muzzle, and its ears are floppy and hang down close to the face. The legs appear sturdy, and the tail is bushy and upright, indicating an alert posture.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression is friendly and curious, with dark, expressive eyes and a slightly open mouth showing its teeth. The overall body shape suggests a breed that is well-suited for outdoor activities, possibly terriers or a similar small breed.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's coat is quite long and appears to be slightly unkempt, which could indicate it",

It has a fluffy texture, which is consistent with the overall appearance of the dog's coat. The tail is positioned upwards and slightly curved, indicating it might be in motion or reacting to something. The size of the tail appears to be medium-sized relative to the dog's body, typical for many breeds. There are no distinctive markings or unique features on the tail itself; it is primarily white with natural variations in color and texture."
