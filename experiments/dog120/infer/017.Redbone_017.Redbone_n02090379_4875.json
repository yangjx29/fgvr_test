Both dogs appear to have short fur.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur looks smooth and well-groomed. There are no visible signs of shedding or mats in the image.\n\n- **Patterns**: The reddish-brown dog has a solid color with no distinct patterns, while the lighter-colored dog has some white markings, which could suggest it might be a mixed breed or have some light-colored genes.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The reddish-brown dog appears slightly larger and has a more rounded head shape with floppy ears. The lighter-colored dog has a narrower head and pointier ears, suggesting a different breed or mix.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The reddish-brown dog's ears are floppy and hang down, while the lighter-colored dog's ears are pointed and stand upright.
