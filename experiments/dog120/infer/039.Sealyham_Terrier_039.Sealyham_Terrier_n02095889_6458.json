They are proportionate to the rest of the body, neither too large nor too small.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's face is expressive, with a black nose and dark eyes that stand out against the lighter fur. The fur around the face is longer and more pronounced, framing the face nicely.\n\nThese features, particularly the long, floppy ears and the shaggy texture, suggest that this could be a Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier (SCWT), also known as a Sealyham Terrier.

Here are the visual characteristics that help distinguish it:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a light cream or white coat with some darker markings, particularly around the eyes and ears, which is typical for the breed. The fur looks soft and slightly wavy, giving it a fluffy appearance.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The coat is thick and dense, with a noticeable amount of hair around the face and legs, which adds to the overall fluffy look. The texture seems soft and not overly coarse.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact and sturdy build, with a broad head and a short muzzle. Its body is relatively small to medium-sized, with a strong, muscular frame. The legs are short and sturdy, contributing to the dog's overall robust appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the long, shaggy beard and eyebrows, which are characteristic of the Sealyham Terrier. These facial markings give the dog a unique and expressive look. Additionally, the tail is typically docked, though this may not be visible in the image due to the angle.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's ears are floppy",

The texture appears soft and slightly wavy, which is characteristic of certain breeds like Sealyham Terriers or Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers. The coat looks thick and fluffy, especially around the neck and chest area, giving it a somewhat shaggy appearance.\n\n- **Color**: Primarily white with subtle beige highlights, particularly noticeable around the ears and back.\n- **Texture**: The fur is soft and wavy, not overly rigid or smooth.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is compact and sturdy, with a medium-sized head and a slightly elongated body. The tail is short and appears to be slightly curved upwards.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's face has a distinct expression with a slightly long snout and floppy ears that hang down close to the head. The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to the overall charm of the dog.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The coat's length and texture suggest it might be a Sealyham Terrier, known for their distinctive wavy, soft fur. The dog's build and facial features also align with this breed.\n\nThese characteristics help distinguish this dog from other breeds with smoother"
