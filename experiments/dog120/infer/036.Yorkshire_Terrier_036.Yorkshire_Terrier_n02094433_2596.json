It has a fine texture, suggesting it might be well-groomed despite its shaggy appearance.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are no visible distinct patterns on the face; the fur is uniformly colored across the face, with slight variations in shade.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The face is small and rounded, typical of many small dog breeds. The eyes are dark and expressive, and the nose is black, adding contrast to the lighter fur. The ears are long and hang down, framing the face nicely.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression is attentive and curious, with wide, alert eyes and perked-up ears.
