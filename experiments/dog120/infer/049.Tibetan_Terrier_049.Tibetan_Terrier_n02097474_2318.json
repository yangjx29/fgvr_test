They have a compact, sturdy build with a thick, soft coat that is predominantly white with shades of beige and gray.

Additionally, the presence of chain collars with tags suggests they are well-cared-for pets, which aligns with the common ownership of Lhasa Apsos.

They are proportionally large compared to the head, which is characteristic of certain breeds like Dandie Dinmonts or West Highland White Terriers.\n- **Unique Features**: The ears are prominent and add to the overall endearing appearance of the dogs.
