The ears are large, floppy, and hang down close to the sides of the head, adding to the dog's gentle and expressive appearance.\n\nThe face is elongated with a slightly rounded muzzle, typical of spaniels. The eyes are dark and almond-shaped, giving the dog an alert yet calm expression. The nose is a light brown color, which contrasts nicely with the white fur. There are no visible patterns or markings on the face, which contributes to the dog's clean and uniform look.\n\nThe overall shape of the dog is medium-sized and well-proportioned, with a sturdy build and a slightly arched back. The tail is curled over the back, which is characteristic of many spaniel breeds. The dog's posture is upright and attentive, suggesting it is alert and ready for action. The combination of the fluffy coat, floppy ears, and expressive eyes makes this dog easily identifiable as a spaniel breed, likely a Clumber Spaniel given the size and coat type.",

The texture appears soft and slightly curly, giving it a fluffy appearance.\n\n- **Color**: The primary color is white, with a slight variation in shade on the ears and lower legs, which could be due to natural pigmentation or lighting.\n- **Texture**: The fur is thick and wavy, contributing to a plush look. The texture seems consistent across the body, with no visible shedding or bald spots.\n- **Shape and Size**: The legs are medium-sized, proportionate to the body, and covered in the same wavy fur. The paws are small and rounded, typical of many breeds.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are long and hang down, adding to the overall elegant appearance. The tail is also long and curls slightly at the end, which is characteristic of certain breeds like the Clumber Spaniel.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The dog's coat is well-groomed, indicating regular care.
