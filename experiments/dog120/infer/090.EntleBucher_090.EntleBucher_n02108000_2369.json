The black coat with tan markings on the chest, legs, and around the muzzle is a hallmark of the EntleBucher. Additionally, the floppy ears, the broad head, and the overall build are also indicative of this breed. The similarity score for EntleBucher is very close to that of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, but the distinct tan markings and the more compact build suggest EntleBucher as the more likely match. | Key Features: Black coat with tan markings on the chest, legs, and around the muzzle; floppy ears; broad head; compact build. | Uncertainty: While the EntleBucher and Greater Swiss Mountain Dog share some similarities, the tan markings and the more compact build of the dog in the image lean towards EntleBucher.

There are also brown patches above the eyes and on the cheeks, creating a mask-like pattern.\n- **Texture**: The fur appears short and smooth, typical of many working dog breeds.\n- **Patterns**: The white markings on the chest and muzzle contrast sharply with the darker fur, making them stand out. The brown patches add depth to the coloration.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is medium-sized, proportionate to the body, and has a broad, square shape typical of breeds like the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, which is characteristic of the breed. The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to the overall alert appearance.\n\nThese features collectively suggest that the dog is likely a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog, known for its robust build and distinctive coat pattern.",

Specifically:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The primary coat color is black, which covers most of the body. The tan markings are present on the chest, legs, and around the muzzle. The fur appears short and smooth, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The tan markings are well-defined and symmetrical, extending from the chest down the legs and around the muzzle. These markings contrast sharply with the black coat, making them easily identifiable.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The tan markings are particularly noticeable around the chest and legs, which are key areas for breed identification. The tan coloration is not only limited to these areas but also extends slightly onto the lower part of the chest and the inner sides of the legs.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The tan markings are consistent and well-defined, which is characteristic of the Entlebucher Sennenhund. There are no unusual or irregularities in the pattern, suggesting a healthy and typical example of the breed.\n\nThese visual characteristics are crucial for distinguishing an Entlebucher Sennenhund from other breeds, as the distinct black and tan",
