Their ears are floppy and hang down close to the sides of their heads, adding to the overall gentle expression. The eyes are almond-shaped and dark, contributing to the friendly look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Spinone Italiano's most distinctive feature is its broad, square-shaped head and sturdy build.
