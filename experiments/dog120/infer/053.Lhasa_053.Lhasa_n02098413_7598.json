The light beige coat with a shaggy texture, the small floppy ears, the dark round eyes, and the overall facial structure are all typical of the Lhasa Apso. The similarity score ranking also places 'Lhasa' as the highest among the candidates, further supporting this classification. The dog's size and build, along with the facial features, align closely with the Lhasa Apso breed. | Key Features: Light beige coat, shaggy texture, small floppy ears, dark round eyes, and the overall facial structure. | Uncertainty: While the dog's coat color and texture are consistent with a Lhasa Apso, the exact shade of beige can vary slightly among different dogs. Additionally, the slight variation in facial features could potentially be attributed to individual differences within the same breed.",
