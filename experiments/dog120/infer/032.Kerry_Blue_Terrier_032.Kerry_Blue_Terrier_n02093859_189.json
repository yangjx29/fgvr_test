            "The Kerry Blue Terrier in the image has a predominantly dark blue-gray coat with a slightly textured appearance, which is characteristic of the breed. The fur appears dense and wavy, giving it a soft yet sturdy look. \n\n- **Color**: The dog's coat is a deep, uniform blue-gray, which is the hallmark color of the Kerry Blue Terrier. There are no visible patterns or markings other than the natural variation in the coat's texture.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The face is broad and square, typical of terriers, with a strong, muscular build. The ears are large, triangular, and stand erect, adding to the alert expression. The size of the ears relative to the head is significant, contributing to the dog's distinctive look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Kerry Blue Terrier's face is broad and flat, with a short muzzle and a black nose. The eyes are dark and expressive, often appearing somewhat almond-shaped. The tail is long and curved upward, often carried high when the dog is excited or alert.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's overall posture and the way it is running suggest agility and energy, which are important traits for the breed. The texture of the coat, combined with the dog's alert expression and the shape",

Here's a detailed description focusing on the body shape and tail:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a dark, almost black coat with a slightly textured appearance, suggesting a thick, possibly curly or wavy fur.\n- **Texture**: The fur appears dense and somewhat rough, indicative of a breed known for such characteristics.\n- **Patterns**: There are no visible distinct patterns or markings on the dog's body; it is uniformly dark.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact and sturdy build, typical of breeds like the Kerry Blue Terrier. Its body is medium-sized, neither too large nor too small.\n- **Tail**: The tail is short and curved upwards, which is a distinctive feature often seen in terrier breeds. It adds to the overall robust and alert appearance of the dog.\n\nThese features collectively suggest that the dog is likely a Kerry Blue Terrier, known for its distinctive dark coat and compact build.",
            "The dog in the image has a dark, almost black coat with a slightly textured appearance. The fur appears dense and somewhat curly, giving it a fluffy look. There are no distinct patterns visible on the fur; it is uniformly colored across the body.\n\nIn terms of shape and size, the dog is medium-sized, with a sturdy build and a compact frame. Its ears are upright and pointed, and the tail is short and curved upwards. The dog's expression is alert and focused, suggesting it might be in motion or attentive to something.\n\nUnique features include the dog's overall robust and muscular build, which is characteristic of certain breeds known for their strength and agility. The texture of the fur, as mentioned, adds to its distinctive appearance, making it stand out against the natural background of grass and dirt. There are no visible markings or spots that would suggest any particular breed, but the combination of color, texture, and build suggests it could be a breed like a Kerry Blue Terrier or a similar type."
