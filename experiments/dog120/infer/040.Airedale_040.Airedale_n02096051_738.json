The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, indicative of a healthy coat. There is a distinct pattern where the black fur covers most of the upper body, while the brown fur is more prominent on the lower body and face, creating a clear contrast.\n\nThe dog's shape is medium-sized, with a sturdy build typical of working breeds. Its ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to its expressive appearance. The dog's eyes are dark and alert, and it has a friendly expression with its mouth slightly open, revealing a pink tongue. A collar and leash are visible, suggesting it is a pet.\n\nUnique features include the dog's well-defined facial markings, with a lighter brown patch around the muzzle and a darker brown stripe running from the top of the head down the center of the face. This pattern, combined with the color gradient, helps distinguish it from other breeds. The overall appearance suggests a breed that is likely used for hunting or working purposes, given its robust build and attentive demeanor."
