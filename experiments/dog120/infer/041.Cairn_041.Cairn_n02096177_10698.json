There are subtle variations in tone, giving it a natural, slightly mottled appearance.\n- **Texture**: The fur appears thick and somewhat wiry, typical of breeds like Cairn Terriers. It has a slightly rough texture, which is evident in the way the hair stands up and catches light.\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large and triangular, standing upright. They are proportionally large compared to the head, adding to the dog's alert expression. The fur around the ears is particularly fluffy and stands out due to its texture.\n- **Unique Features**: The fur around the eyes is slightly lighter, creating a contrast that frames the dark eyes. The ears have a darker, almost blackish hue at the tips, which adds depth to their appearance.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The fur around the muzzle is shorter and smoother compared to the rest of the head, which helps define the facial features.

The fur appears slightly wiry and textured, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur is short and dense, with a slightly rough texture. There are no visible patterns other than the natural coloration and the darker areas around the eyes and ears.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's face is compact and rounded, with a short muzzle and large, pointed ears that stand upright. The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to the dog's alert and attentive expression.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's facial features, including the shape of the nose, the placement of the eyes, and the overall structure of the head, are characteristic of the Cairn Terrier breed. The wiry fur texture is another key feature that distinguishes this breed from others.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The dog's expression seems curious or slightly apprehensive, which can be attributed to its direct gaze and the slight tilt",
