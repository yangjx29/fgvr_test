Its head is small and elongated, with a slightly rounded top and a short muzzle. The ears are small, triangular, and stand upright, adding to the terrier's alert appearance.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: One of the most distinctive features of a Border Terrier is its \"tartan\" pattern, which can be seen in the fur's coloration. This pattern is not immediately visible in the image due to the lighting and angle, but it is characteristic of the breed. Additionally, the dog's tail is docked, which is common for this breed, though not always the case.\n\n4. **Variations or Special Characteristics**: Border Terriers are",

It has a light brown coloration with some darker tips, matching the overall coat pattern.\n\n- **Legs**: The front legs are short and sturdy, with a light brown color that blends into the darker areas around the joints. The back legs are also visible, showing a similar color pattern and texture. The legs appear proportionate to the body, indicating a compact build.\n\nThese features suggest that the dog is likely a Border Terrier, known for its distinctive coat and sturdy yet compact build.
