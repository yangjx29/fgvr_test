The ears are triangular and stand upright, contributing to the dog's alert expression.\n\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - The eyes are dark and expressive, with a somewhat intense gaze.\n  - The snout is broad and strong, with a slightly wrinkled forehead.\n  - The eyebrows are prominent, adding to the dog's distinctive facial structure.\n  - The teeth are visible when the dog is panting, indicating a healthy mouth.\n\nThese characteristics collectively distinguish the Giant Schnauzer from other breeds, making it easily recognizable."
