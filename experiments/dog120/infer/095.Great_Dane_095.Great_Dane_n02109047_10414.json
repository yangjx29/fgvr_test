Here's a detailed description of the ridge:\n\n- **Color**: The ridge appears to be a lighter shade compared to the rest of the dog's coat, which is a golden-brown color. This lighter coloration creates a noticeable contrast against the darker fur.\n- **Texture**: The ridge has a slightly different texture than the surrounding fur. It appears smoother and more defined, almost like a raised line running along the spine.\n- **Shape and Size**: The ridge is relatively narrow and runs the length of the dog's back, starting from the base of the neck and extending to the tail. Its shape is straight and continuous, without any curves or breaks.\n- **Unique Features**: The ridge is a hallmark of the Great Dane breed and is often referred to as the \"dorsal crest.\" It is a genetic trait that can vary in prominence among individuals of the same breed.\n- **Variations**: While most Great Danes have some form of a ridge, the size and prominence can vary.
