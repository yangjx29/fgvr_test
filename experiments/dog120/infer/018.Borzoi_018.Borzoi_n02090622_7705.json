The texture of the coat looks thick and slightly wavy, adding to the Otterhound's signature appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog stands on a table, and its body is proportionally long and lean, with a deep chest and a muscular build. Its legs are long and strong, supporting its tall stance. The head is large and broad, with a flat top and a short muzzle, which is characteristic of the breed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Otterhound's most distinctive feature is its long, pendulous ears that hang down close to the ground, giving it a unique facial expression. The tail is not visible in the image, but Otterhounds typically have a long, bushy tail that curls over their back.\n\n- **Variations**: Otterhounds are known for their versatility in color, often seen in shades of fawn, black and tan, or white.
