The fur around the eyes and muzzle is darker, creating a contrast against the lighter areas.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur appears soft and thick, giving it a shaggy appearance. It looks well-groomed, with no visible mats or tangles. The texture is dense, especially around the head and neck area.\n\n- **Patterns**: The fur has a mix of solid white and gray patches, with some darker areas around the eyes and muzzle. There are no distinct patterns, just a natural variation in coloration.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's face is rounded, typical of breeds like Shih Tzus or Lhasa Apsos. The ears are not visible in the image, suggesting they may be folded or tucked close to the head. The overall size of the dog appears small, consistent with a lapdog breed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression seems calm and slightly melancholic, with droopy eyes and a relaxed posture.

Its eyes are dark and expressive, with a slightly glossy appearance that reflects light, indicating they might be moist or healthy. The eyes are medium-sized and oval-shaped, giving the dog an alert yet calm expression.\n\nThe nose is black and appears to be wet, which is common for dogs after eating or drinking. It is small in comparison to the overall size of the dog's head, adding to its endearing look. The fur around the nose is slightly longer and more textured, creating a distinct mustache-like feature. This texture contrasts with the smoother fur on the rest of the face, making it a noticeable characteristic.\n\nThe dog's eyes and nose are central to its facial features, contributing significantly to its overall appearance.
