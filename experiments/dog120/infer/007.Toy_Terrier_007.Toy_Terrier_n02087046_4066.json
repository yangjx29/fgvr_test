The white coat with brown markings around the eyes and back is also typical of Rat Terriers, which can have various color patterns including brindle, fawn, and white. The overall size and build of the dog, along with its alert expression, further support this identification. The similarity scores provided by the search engine also suggest that the Rat Terrier is one of the top candidates, with a score higher than other breeds listed. | Key Features: Large, upright, and pointed ears; white coat with brown markings around the eyes and back; compact, sturdy build; alert and attentive expression. | Uncertainty: While the visual evidence strongly supports the Rat Terrier classification, it is possible that the dog could be a mixed breed or a variant of the Rat Terrier.

            "The dog in the image appears to be a small breed with distinct facial and ear features. Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The dog has a predominantly white coat with brown patches, particularly around the eyes, ears, and back. The fur looks smooth and short, typical of many small breeds.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large, upright, and pointed, which is characteristic of breeds like the Rat Terrier or Rat-a-Tat. They are proportionally large compared to the head, adding to the alert and attentive appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, giving it an alert expression. The fur around the eyes is darker, creating a mask-like effect. The nose is small and dark, fitting the overall small breed profile.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The dog's ears stand out as a key feature, being large and erect, which is a hallmark of the Rat Terrier breed. The coat pattern, while not unique to any single breed, suggests a mix of colors often seen in mixed-breed dogs or specific rat terrier varieties.\n\nThese features collectively suggest the dog could be a Rat Terrier or a similar small breed with similar physical traits.",
            "The image shows a small dog with a predominantly white coat and brown markings. The dog's fur appears short and smooth, with a slightly textured look around the ears and face. The brown patches are concentrated on the head, back, and legs, creating a distinct contrast against the white fur.\n\n- **Color**: The primary colors are white and brown. The white fur covers most of the body, while the brown is more prominent on the head, back, and legs.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks soft and well-groomed, with a slight sheen visible in the lighting.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact, sturdy build typical of small breeds. Its ears are large and pointed, standing upright, which adds to its alert appearance. The legs are proportionate to the body, with the front legs being slightly longer than the hind legs.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, and it has a small, rounded nose. A collar with a tag is visible around its neck, indicating it is a pet.\n- **Variations**: There are no significant variations in the fur pattern; the brown patches are consistent across the areas they cover. The dog's overall appearance is uniform and well-maintained.\n\nThis description",
            "The collar and tag in the image appear to be made of a light-colored material, possibly leather or a synthetic equivalent, with a smooth texture. The collar is thin and fits snugly around the dog's neck. The tag attached to the collar is round and metallic, likely made of brass or a similar material, giving it a shiny appearance. The tag has a small hole at the top, which is used to attach it to the collar. There are no visible breed-specific markings or text on the tag, making it difficult to determine if there are any specific details related to the dog's identification. The overall design is simple and functional, typical of pet collars and tags."
