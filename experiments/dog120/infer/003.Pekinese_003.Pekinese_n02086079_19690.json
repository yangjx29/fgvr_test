The texture is soft and fluffy, typical of the breed's double coat.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The Pekingese is small in stature, with a compact and sturdy build. Its head is large in proportion to its body, with a flat skull and a short muzzle. The ears are small and erect, often folded over at the tips.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most noticeable feature is the dog's facial expression, which includes a slightly open mouth showing its tongue, giving it an endearing and playful look. The eyes are large and expressive, adding to its charming appearance.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: Pekingese dogs are known for their curled tails, which are often held high above their backs. While not fully visible in this image, the tail is likely curled and could be a distinguishing characteristic if seen more clearly. Additionally, the dog's overall body structure, including its short legs and compact frame, is consistent with the breed standard.\n\nThese visual cues help distinguish the Pekingese from other breeds, particularly those that might share similar",
