The texture appears soft and slightly shaggy, typical of certain breeds like Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers. There are no visible patterns other than the natural color variation.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The dog's body is compact and rounded, with a medium-sized head and a sturdy build. Its posture is relaxed, lying down on what appears to be a tiled floor, suggesting a calm demeanor.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog has a prominent black nose and dark eyes, which stand out against its lighter fur.
