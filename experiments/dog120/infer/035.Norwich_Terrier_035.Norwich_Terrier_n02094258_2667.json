The fur on the tail is also thicker and more voluminous compared to the rest of the body, giving it a fluffy appearance. The fur on the head and ears is shorter and more tightly curled, contrasting with the longer, softer fur on the body and tail.\n\nThe dog's overall coat is a mix of black and tan, with the black covering most of the back and the tan coloring the sides and legs. The fur texture varies across different parts of the body, with the tail being particularly noticeable due to its thickness and distinct coloration.
