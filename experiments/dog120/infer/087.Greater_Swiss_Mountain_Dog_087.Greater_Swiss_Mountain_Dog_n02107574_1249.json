Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a tri-color coat with a predominantly black base color, white markings on the chest, paws, and face, and tan markings on the cheeks, muzzle, and legs. This is characteristic of the GSD breed.\n\n- **Texture**: The coat is thick, dense, and wiry, which is typical for the GSD. It is not smooth but rather has a rough, slightly coarse texture that provides protection against harsh weather conditions.\n\n- **Patterns**: The coat displays a clear tricolor pattern, with distinct patches of black, white, and tan. The white markings are symmetrical and well-defined, while the tan markings are more subtle but still noticeable.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is medium to large in size, with a sturdy and muscular build. Its head is broad, with a strong jawline and a black nose. The ears are triangular and stand erect when alert.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The GSD has a distinctive facial expression, often described as \"smiling,\" due to the shape of its mouth and the way it holds its lips. The eyes are almond-shaped and dark",
