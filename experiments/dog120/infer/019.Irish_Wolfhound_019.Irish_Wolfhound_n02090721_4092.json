It has a soft, woolly appearance that can vary in length across different parts of the body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is large and broad, with a long muzzle that tapers slightly towards the nose.

            "The dog in the image has a long, shaggy coat with varying lengths across different areas of its body. The fur appears thick and somewhat wiry, particularly noticeable around the legs and chest, giving it a textured appearance. The coat is predominantly light beige or cream-colored, with some darker shades around the ears and muzzle, suggesting a possible brindle pattern.\n\nThe dog's body is medium-sized, with a sturdy build. Its head is large in proportion to its body, featuring a broad forehead and a slightly elongated snout. The fur around the face is longer and more pronounced, covering the eyes partially, which adds to the dog's expressive look. The ears are floppy and covered in the same long, shaggy fur as the rest of the body.\n\nDistinctive features include the dog's collar, which is dark brown leather with a green tag attached, and a red leash hanging down. The dog's overall appearance suggests it might be an Irish Wolfhound or a similar breed known for its long, thick coat. The texture and length of the fur are key distinguishing factors, setting it apart from breeds with shorter, smoother coats.",
