The coat pattern, with its speckled white and gray spots, is typical of the Walker Hound. Additionally, the head region shows a mix of white, black, and brown with distinct markings, which is consistent with the breed's appearance. The floppy ears and the overall body structure further support this identification. The similarity score of 0.3331 also indicates a high likelihood of this being a Walker Hound. | Key Features: ['Speckled coat pattern with white and gray spots', 'Medium-sized head with a white blaze and darker patches', 'Floppy ears', 'Proportionate snout'] | Uncertainty: ['While the Walker Hound is highly likely, other breeds like the Basset Hound share some similarities, but the speckled coat pattern is more characteristic of the Walker Hound.']",

The primary colors are a blend of white and black, with some brown tones present around the eyes and ears. The fur appears smooth and short, typical of many hound breeds.\n\n- **Color**: The head features a combination of white, black, and brown. The white is prominent on the muzzle and around the eyes, while the black covers the top of the head and ears. Brown is noticeable around the eyes and on the ears.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks smooth and not overly thick, which is consistent with a hunting or working breed.\n- **Patterns**: There are distinct markings, including a white blaze running down the center of the face and a darker patch over the eyes. The ears have a darker coloration compared to the rest of the head.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is proportionate to the body, with a medium-sized snout and floppy ears that hang down close to the head.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog has a gentle expression, with dark, expressive eyes that stand out against the lighter fur. The ears are large and floppy, adding to the characteristic look of the breed.\n\nThese features collectively suggest that the dog could be a",
