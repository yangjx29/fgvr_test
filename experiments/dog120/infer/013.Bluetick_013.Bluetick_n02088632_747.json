The medium to large size, thick and slightly shaggy coat, and the broad, slightly rounded head shape are indicative of this breed.

While the similarity scores suggest other breeds like the Great Dane and English Setter could be close matches, the specific combination of features such as the coat texture, ear shape, and facial structure align more closely with the German Short-haired Pointer. | Key Features: Medium to large size, thick and shaggy coat, broad head shape, floppy ears, dark expressive eyes, and alert posture. | Uncertainty: The similarity scores to other breeds are quite close, indicating a high degree of visual similarity.
