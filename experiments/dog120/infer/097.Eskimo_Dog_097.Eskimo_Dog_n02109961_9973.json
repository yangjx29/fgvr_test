The fur appears soft and slightly fluffy, typical of breeds like Huskies. The brown markings are primarily on the top of the head, around the eyes, and on the ears.\n\n- **Patterns**: The brown markings create a mask-like pattern around the eyes, extending down the sides of the face. The fur on the snout is mostly white, with some light brown speckles near the nose. The ears have a mix of white and brown fur, with the brown being more prominent at the tips.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The face is medium-sized, proportionate to the body, and has a broad, flat appearance typical of Huskies. The eyes are almond-shaped and expressive, with a golden-brown hue. The nose is a light pinkish-brown color, and the mouth area shows some light brown fur, possibly indicating a slight injury or irritation.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes are a key distinguishing feature, with their intense, alert expression.

The stripe is a mix of white and brown, creating a striking contrast.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The eyes are almond-shaped and medium-sized, positioned symmetrically on either side of the head. The nose is broad and pinkish-brown, with some visible whiskers extending outward.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes have a unique, expressive look due to their shape and the surrounding fur pattern.
