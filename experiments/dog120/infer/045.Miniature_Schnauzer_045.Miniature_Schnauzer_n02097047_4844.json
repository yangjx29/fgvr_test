            "The dog's face, particularly its snout and whiskers, is a key feature for identifying it. The snout is short and broad, typical of the Miniature Schnauzer breed. The fur around the snout is dense and wiry, with a mix of black and silver-gray colors, creating a distinctive pattern. The whiskers are prominent and well-defined, extending outward from the muzzle, adding to the dog's expressive appearance. The texture of the fur is rough and coarse, which is characteristic of the breed. The overall shape of the face is square, contributing to the dog's sturdy and alert expression. The coloration is predominantly dark gray with lighter gray markings, giving it a salt-and-pepper look. This combination of features—short snout, dense wiry fur, prominent whiskers, and square face—helps distinguish this dog from other breeds.",

Its ears are small and stand upright, adding to its alert expression. The dog also wears a blue collar, which adds a pop of color against its dark fur.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's overall build is muscular yet elegant, with a strong jawline and a confident stance. The combination of its facial features, coat texture, and body structure makes it easily recognizable as a Miniature Schnauzer.",
