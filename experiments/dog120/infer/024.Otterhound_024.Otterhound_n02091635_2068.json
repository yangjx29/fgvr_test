The texture is consistent across the body, with no visible patterns other than the natural coat variation.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact and sturdy build, typical of working terriers. Its body is proportionate, with a slightly longer back and a well-defined waist. The legs are strong and muscular, supporting the dog's overall robust appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - **Head**: The head is broad and slightly rounded, with a short muzzle. The ears are pendant and hang close to the head, covered in the same soft, wavy fur.\n  - **Eyes**: The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to the dog's gentle yet alert expression.\n  - **Tail**: The tail is thick at the base and tapers to a point, often carried low when the dog is relaxed.\n\n- **"
