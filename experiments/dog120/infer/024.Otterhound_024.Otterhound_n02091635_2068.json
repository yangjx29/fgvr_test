The tail is not prominently visible in the image, suggesting it may be short or tucked close to the body. The dog's posture is upright and alert, indicating a healthy and active demeanor.\n\nUnique features include the dog's facial structure, which has a slightly elongated muzzle and expressive eyes that are partially obscured by the long fur around them.
