The ears are medium-sized, triangular, and hang close to the head, blending into the overall coloration of the coat. The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to the dog's alert and intelligent expression. The muzzle is short and strong, contributing to the dog's sturdy build.

The overall shape of the head is balanced and harmonious with the rest of the body, reflecting the breed's well-proportioned structure.",

This is characteristic of the breed's distinctive coloration.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is dense and stands up in places, giving it a rugged appearance typical of terriers. The texture is not smooth but rather has a slightly coarse feel.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact, sturdy build with a medium-sized frame. Its body is well-proportioned, with a strong, muscular neck and a broad chest. The head is medium-sized, with a slightly rounded skull and a short muzzle. The ears are small, triangular, and set high on the head, often folded over at the tips.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Kerry Blue Terrier typically has a curled tail, which is visible in the image. The tail is thick at the base and tapers to a point. The dog also wears a green collar, which adds a pop of color against its blue-gray coat.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The dog's coat is naturally wavy and does not require frequent grooming. The breed is known for its intelligence and lively",
            "The tail of the dog in the image is positioned high and slightly curved upwards, indicating a typical terrier stance. It appears to be of medium length, neither too short nor overly long, which is characteristic of many terrier breeds. The tail's color matches the rest of the dog's coat, which is a uniform grayish-blue with a slightly rough, wiry texture. There are no distinct patterns or markings on the tail; it maintains the same color and texture throughout. The tail's shape is rounded at the tip, which is a common feature among terriers for balance and agility. Overall, the tail's appearance is consistent with the breed's typical physical traits, aiding in distinguishing it from other terrier breeds based on this specific characteristic."
