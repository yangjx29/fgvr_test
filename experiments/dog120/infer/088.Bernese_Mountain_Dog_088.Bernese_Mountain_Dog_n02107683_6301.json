The fur looks thick and slightly wavy, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Eyes**: The eyes are almond-shaped and dark brown, giving the dog an alert and intelligent expression. They are set wide apart, which is characteristic of the breed.\n\n- **Ears**: The ears are floppy and hang down close to the sides of the head. They are large and rounded at the tips, adding to the dog's gentle and friendly appearance.\n\n- **Size Relative to the Object**: The dog is significantly larger than the person sitting next to it, indicating its substantial size typical for a full-grown Bernese Mountain Dog.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the tricolor coat, the shape and size of the ears, and the overall body structure are distinctive features of the Bernese Mountain Dog breed.\n\nThese characteristics collectively help distinguish the dog in the image from other breeds.",
