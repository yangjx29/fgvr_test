The dog's body is medium-sized, with a sturdy build typical of a working or hunting breed.

The eyes themselves are not clearly visible due to the angle and the dog's expression, but they seem to be dark in color, which is typical for many dog breeds.\n\nThe dog's nose is black, and its mouth is open, revealing its pink tongue and teeth, indicating it is either yawning or panting. The overall texture of the fur appears smooth and well-groomed, without any visible shedding or mats.\n\nThe dog's facial features, including the shape of the ears and the relaxed expression, contribute to a calm and friendly demeanor.

It looks clean and well-maintained.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are distinct white patches on the chest and paws, which contrast with the brown fur. The overall pattern is natural and symmetrical.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a medium build, neither too large nor too small. Its body is proportionate, with a balanced head and torso. The ears are floppy and hang down, adding to the relaxed appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's mouth is open, revealing its teeth and tongue, which gives it a relaxed or yawning expression. This is a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other dogs in a calm pose.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's posture is laid-back, with its legs stretched out in front.
