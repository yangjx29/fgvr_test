The fur appears smooth and well-groomed, with a darker shade around the muzzle and ears, which contrasts nicely with the lighter brown on the rest of the body.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is short and dense, giving the dog a sturdy appearance. The texture is smooth and shiny, reflecting light in certain areas, particularly on the head and chest.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are no distinct patterns on the dog’s coat; it is uniformly colored with a gradient from darker at the tips of the ears and muzzle to lighter on the body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact, muscular build typical of the Griffon breed. Its head is large in proportion to its body, with a broad skull and a short muzzle. The ears are small, triangular, and stand upright, adding to the alert expression. The eyes are dark and expressive, contributing to the dog's intelligent and watchful demeanor.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the dog's facial structure, characterized by a flat, square",
