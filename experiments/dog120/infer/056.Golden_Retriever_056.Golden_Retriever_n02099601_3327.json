The ears are floppy and hang down on either side of the head, adding to the characteristic look of the breed. The fur appears smooth and short, typical of many retriever breeds.

The dog's coat is a rich golden-brown color, with a slightly wavy texture that suggests it might be a retriever or a similar breed known for their dense, water-resistant fur. The dog has a broad head with a short muzzle, and its ears are floppy and hang down close to the sides of its head. The eyes are dark and expressive, and the dog appears to be wet, likely having been swimming, as evidenced by the water droplets around its mouth and the slight ripples in the pool behind it.

The fur on the legs appears to be slightly longer than the body fur, giving them a more textured appearance.\n   - The back legs are also visible, with the hindquarters resting on the edge of the pool.
