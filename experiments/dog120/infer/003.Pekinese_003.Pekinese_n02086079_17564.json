The texture seems consistent throughout the costume, without any visible variations.\n\n- **Patterns**: The costume has a playful pattern with white eyes and a small white nose on the front, giving it a cute, almost monster-like appearance. The ears are large and floppy, adding to the whimsical look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The costume fits snugly around the dog's head and neck, covering most of the head area. It is relatively small compared to the dog's body, which allows the dog's face and part of its body to be visible.
