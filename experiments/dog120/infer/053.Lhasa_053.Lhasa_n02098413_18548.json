The thick, fluffy, and shaggy coat is prominent, especially around the head and neck, which is typical for this breed. The face has a mix of white and beige fur with darker markings around the eyes and muzzle, which is also characteristic of Tibetan Terriers. Additionally, the floppy ears and the overall body shape align well with the breed's description. While the similarity scores suggest other breeds like Pekinese and Giant Schnauzer could be close matches, the combination of coat texture, facial markings, and ear shape strongly supports the Tibetan Terrier classification. | Key Features: Thick, fluffy coat; shaggy around the head and neck; mix of white and beige fur with darker markings around the eyes and muzzle; floppy ears; overall body shape | Uncertainty: The water reflection and lighting conditions may slightly obscure some finer details, but the overall visual evidence is strong enough to confidently identify the breed.",
