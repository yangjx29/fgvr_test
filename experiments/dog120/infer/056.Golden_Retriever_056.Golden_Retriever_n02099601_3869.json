The fur appears soft and slightly wavy, with a natural sheen that suggests a healthy coat. The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, with a gentle gaze that conveys a calm and attentive demeanor. The ears are floppy and covered in long, flowing fur that frames the face, adding to the overall gentle appearance.\n\nThe facial structure is typical of the breed, with a broad head and a strong, yet not overly large, snout. The nose is black and prominent, contrasting nicely with the golden fur around it. The whiskers are fine and well-defined, extending outward from the muzzle. The overall expression is one of quiet contemplation or mild curiosity, with no signs of distress or aggression.\n\nThis dog's features are distinct due to the uniformity and richness of the golden color, which is consistent across the face and visible parts of the body. The texture of the fur adds depth and dimension to the image, making the dog appear warm and inviting. There are no visible markings or patterns other than the natural variation in the fur's density and color intensity, which enhances the dog's natural beauty.",
