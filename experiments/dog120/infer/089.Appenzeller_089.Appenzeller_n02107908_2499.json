Since the tails are not visible in the image, we cannot provide a detailed description of them. However, I can describe what typically distinguishes the tail of a Bernese Mountain Dog:\n\n- **Color**: The tail of a Bernese Mountain Dog is usually black with white markings. The base of the tail may be black, transitioning to white towards the tip.\n- **Texture**: The tail has a soft, thick coat, consistent with the dog's overall dense fur.\n- **Shape and Size**: The tail is typically long and bushy, with a slight curve at the end. It is proportionate to the body size of the dog, being neither too short nor excessively long.\n- **Unique Features**: The tail often has a white patch near the base, which can extend up to the root of the tail. This white marking is a distinctive feature of the breed.\n\nSince the tails are not visible in the provided image, these descriptions are general and based on typical characteristics of the breed."
