Here's a detailed description focusing on the face and ears:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly black coat with some areas showing slight variations in shade, possibly due to lighting or natural coloration differences. The fur is thick and appears slightly wavy or curly.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is dense and has a somewhat coarse texture, which is characteristic of the breed. This texture is particularly noticeable around the face and ears.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are no distinct patterns visible on the face; it is uniformly black. The texture of the fur is more pronounced around the face compared to other parts of the body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large and drop down on either side of the head. They appear to be thick and have a similar texture to the rest of the fur. The ears are not pointed but rather rounded at the tips.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Black Russian Terrier typically has a broad head, a strong jaw, and a thick neck. These features are not directly visible in this image, but the overall build of the dog suggests these traits.
