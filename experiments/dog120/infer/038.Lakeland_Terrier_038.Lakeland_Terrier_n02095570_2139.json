The face has a distinctive pattern with a white blaze down the center, extending from the forehead to the chest, and dark markings around the eyes and muzzle.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's head is large in proportion to its body, with a broad skull and a strong jawline. The ears are long and hang down close to the cheeks, adding to the overall robust look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression seems calm and alert, with a slightly open mouth showing its teeth, which could indicate it is relaxed or panting. The eyes are dark and expressive, contributing to the breed's intelligent and friendly demeanor.\n\nThese characteristics collectively help distinguish the Airedale Terrier from other breeds, making it easily recognizable.",

The texture seems soft and slightly wavy, which is typical for certain breeds like the Airedale Terrier. The ears are medium-sized in relation to the dog's head, not overly large but prominent enough to be noticeable. There are no distinct patterns or markings on the ears; they are uniformly colored. The ears' shape is rounded at the base and taper towards the tips, which adds to their characteristic appearance. No other breeds share these exact ear features, making them a distinctive characteristic of this particular dog.",
