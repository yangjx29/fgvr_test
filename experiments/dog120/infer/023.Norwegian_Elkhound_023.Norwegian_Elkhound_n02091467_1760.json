There are subtle darker gray markings around the eyes, which give a somewhat alert expression. The ears are pointed and stand upright, adding to the dog's attentive appearance. The overall shape of the head is typical for a Norwegian Elkhound, characterized by a strong, muscular build. The size of the head is proportionate to the body, maintaining the breed's balanced proportions. The dog's facial features include a black nose and a pink tongue visible when the dog is panting, indicating good health. The eyes are dark and expressive, contributing to the dog's friendly demeanor.",

The texture appears soft and slightly wavy, typical of Norwegian Elkhound coats. The pattern is relatively uniform across the body, with no distinct markings or spots. The dog's body is medium-sized, and the coat covers the entire visible area, including the chest and back. The fur around the neck and shoulders seems slightly thicker, forming a mane-like appearance. There are no unique or distinctive features such as spots or patches that set it apart from other breeds. The overall appearance suggests a healthy, well-groomed dog with a natural, undisturbed coat.",
            "The tail of the dog in the image is predominantly white with some grayish tones at the tip. It has a fluffy texture, which is characteristic of Norwegian Elkhounds, known for their thick, double coat. The tail is relatively short compared to the body, curving slightly upwards and outwards. There are no distinct markings or patterns on the tail itself; it appears uniform in color and texture throughout. The tail's size is moderate, neither too long nor too short, fitting well within the overall proportions of the dog's body. This combination of color, texture, and shape helps distinguish the tail from other breeds, particularly those with longer or more pointed tails."
