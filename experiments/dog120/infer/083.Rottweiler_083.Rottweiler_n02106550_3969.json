These include the medium to large size, the predominantly black coat with tan markings, the upright triangular ears, and the broad, friendly expression with visible teeth. The physical build, including the muscular and compact body shape, further supports this identification. The similarity scores provided by the search also indicate a high likelihood of the dog being a Rottweiler, with the score for 'Doberman' being the closest but still significantly lower than the Rottweiler score. | Key Features: Medium to large size, predominantly black coat with tan markings, upright triangular ears, broad friendly expression with visible teeth, muscular and compact body shape | Uncertainty: While the dog shares some similarities with other breeds like Dobermans, the combination of specific features such as the tan markings, the broad face, and the overall body shape strongly suggest a Rottweiler.
