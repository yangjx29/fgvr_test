The coat is medium-length, neither too short nor overly long, which adds to its well-groomed appearance. The dog's ears are floppy and hang down, adding to its expressive face. The overall size of the dog seems moderate, neither tiny nor large, fitting within the average range for a spaniel breed. There are no visible unique markings or tags that stand out as distinctive features beyond the natural coat pattern.",

They appear to be a rich brown color with some darker, possibly slightly wavy or textured fur, which contrasts with the white fur on the rest of its face. The ears are relatively large compared to the dog's head, adding to their prominence. There is no visible pattern within the ears themselves, but the texture suggests a soft, possibly slightly frizzy appearance.
