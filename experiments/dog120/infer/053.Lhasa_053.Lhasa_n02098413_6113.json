The dog has a compact, sturdy build with a head that is proportionally large compared to its body, which aligns well with the typical Dandi Dinmont. The coat is thick, shaggy, and slightly wiry, covering the entire body, including the face and ears, which is characteristic of the breed. Additionally, the facial structure, including the dark, almond-shaped eyes and the beard-like appearance around the mouth, is also indicative of the Dandi Dinmont. The similarity score to Dandi Dinmont is the highest among the candidates, further supporting this classification. | Key Features: Compact body, large head, thick shaggy coat, dark almond-shaped eyes, beard-like fur around the mouth, small rounded ears hanging close to the head | Uncertainty: While the Dandi Dinmont is the top candidate, slight variations in coat texture and eye shape could potentially suggest a mix with other breeds.

The ears are small and folded over, blending into the fur. The overall size of the dog appears compact, suggesting it might be a smaller breed. The fur around the neck area looks slightly lighter than the rest of the body, possibly indicating a collar or a lighter undercoat. The dog's expression is calm and attentive."
