There is also some brownish or tan coloring around its muzzle and legs, which is common in Border Collies.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks thick and slightly wavy, typical of working breeds like Border Collies, which often have a double coat for protection against harsh weather conditions.\n- **Patterns**: The white markings on the chest and possibly the face create a distinct contrast against the darker fur, which is a common pattern in many herding breeds.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog appears medium-sized, neither too large nor too small. Its head is elongated with a slightly pointed muzzle, which is characteristic of Border Collies. The ears are long and floppy, hanging down close to the head.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression seems alert and attentive, with its mouth open as if panting or smiling, which is a common trait in dogs that are engaged or happy. The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to the overall friendly appearance.\n\nThese features collectively suggest that",
