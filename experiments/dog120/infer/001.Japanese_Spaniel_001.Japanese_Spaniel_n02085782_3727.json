The texture of the fur appears soft and fluffy, typical of a small breed. The ears are floppy and slightly rounded at the tips. The overall size of the dog is small, consistent with a toy breed.

The dog's body is compact and well-proportioned, fitting comfortably on the plaid-patterned couch. Its face is expressive, with large, dark eyes and a small, pointed nose. The ears are slightly floppy and stand out due to their darker coloration compared to the rest of the coat.

The fur looks soft and slightly fluffy, giving it a plush appearance. Its eyes are dark and expressive, and it has a small, pointed nose. The dog's ears are medium-sized and stand upright, adding to its alert expression.\n\nIn terms of size, the dog is relatively small, likely a toy or teacup breed given its compact stature and the way it fits comfortably on the plaid couch. It has a stocky build with a short, smooth coat that contributes to its overall small size.\n\nDistinctive features include its perked-up ears, bright eyes, and the contrast between the white and brown fur. The dog's posture is upright and attentive, suggesting it is alert and possibly curious about something off-camera. There are no visible markings or patterns other than the natural coloration mentioned above. The dog's size and proportions are consistent with breeds like the Japanese Chin or a similar small companion dog."
