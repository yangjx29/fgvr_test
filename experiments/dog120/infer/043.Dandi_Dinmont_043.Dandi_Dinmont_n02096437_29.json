The fur is thick and slightly wavy, giving it a soft and fluffy appearance.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur is dense and appears slightly shaggy, especially around the legs and chest. There are no distinct patterns, but the contrast between the darker gray and lighter cream fur creates a natural, mottled effect.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small to medium-sized, with a broad head and a short, sturdy body. Its legs are relatively short compared to its body, contributing to its compact stature. The ears are long and hang down close to the sides of the head, adding to the overall rounded look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's face is expressive, with large, dark eyes and a black nose. The fur around the face is particularly fluffy, framing the face nicely. The tail is not visible in the image, but Dandie Dinmont Terriers typically have a short, docked tail.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: This breed is known",
