There are no distinct color patterns other than the uniform white fur.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur appears thick and somewhat curly or wavy, contributing to a soft and voluminous look. This texture is consistent across the visible areas of the dog's face and body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's head is rounded, typical of many poodle breeds, and the ears are medium-sized and hang down on either side of the head. The overall size of the dog seems moderate, neither too small nor too large for its breed.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog has a black nose and dark eyes, which stand out against the white fur. The expression appears calm and attentive. A red collar with a tag is visible around its neck, adding a pop of color to the otherwise monochromatic appearance.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The dog's fur is particularly noticeable due to its thickness and texture, which could be a result of grooming or natural coat type. The overall appearance suggests it might be a poodle",

They have a rounded shape at the tips, which is characteristic of poodles. The ears appear to be well-groomed, maintaining their natural shape without any signs of droopiness or flattening.
