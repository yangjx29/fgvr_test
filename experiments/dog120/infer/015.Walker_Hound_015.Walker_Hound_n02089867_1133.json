The brown coloration is primarily on the head, ears, and back, while the legs and chest are predominantly white.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks smooth and medium-length, typical of hounds.\n- **Patterns**: There is a distinct patch of brown on the dog's forehead, which extends down the sides of its face, creating a mask-like appearance. The ears are brown and stand upright, though they may droop slightly.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's head is elongated, characteristic of hounds, with a broad muzzle. The ears are medium-sized and pointed at the tips.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, and it has a friendly expression.

Here are the visual details:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The dog has a predominantly white coat with brown patches, particularly around the ears, face, and back. The fur looks smooth and short, typical of a Beagle mix rather than a purebred Beagle which often has longer, softer fur.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is medium-sized, neither too large nor too small. Its body shape is compact and sturdy, consistent with a Beagle mix. The head is proportionate to the body, with a broad skull and a slightly elongated muzzle, which are characteristic of Beagles.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog has a black nose and dark eyes, which are common in Beagle mixes. The ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, another typical feature of Beagles. The tail is not fully visible but seems to be of moderate length, which is also consistent with Beagle mixes.\n\n- **Patterns**: The brown patches on the dog’s coat are irregular and not symmetrical, which is more typical of mixed breeds compared to the more uniform patterns seen in purebred Beagles.\n\nOverall, while the dog",

The tail is mostly white with some brown at the tip.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks smooth and short, typical of many hound breeds.\n- **Patterns**: The brown patches are irregularly shaped and distributed across the body, giving it a distinctive brindle appearance.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is medium-sized, standing upright next to the person. Its body is proportionate, with a lean yet muscular build characteristic of hunting dogs.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog has a long, narrow muzzle, which is a common feature in hounds, aiding in their sense of smell.
