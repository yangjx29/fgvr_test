The texture of the fur looks fine and glossy.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is slender and elongated, typical of the Whippet breed. Its head is small in proportion to its body, with a long muzzle and narrow snout. The ears are small and erect, standing upright.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Whippet's eyes are almond-shaped and dark, giving it an alert and intelligent expression. The nose is black, and the mouth is closed, showing no visible teeth. The overall head shape is elongated and narrow.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: Whippets often have a lean build, and this one exhibits that characteristic. The breed is known for its speed and agility, which is reflected in its streamlined body structure. The white patch on the chest is a common color variation within the breed, though not all Whippets will have this marking.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the Whippet from other breeds, such as Greyhounds, which might also share some physical traits like a slender build and long legs",

The texture seems smooth and sleek, typical of sighthound breeds.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is long and lean, with a narrow waist and broad shoulders. Its legs are long and slender, contributing to an overall streamlined appearance. The size appears medium to large for a sighthound, with a height that suggests it could be around 20-30 inches at the shoulder.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog has a long muzzle, which is a common feature in sighthounds, aiding in their keen sense of smell and speed. Its ears are small and erect, which is also typical for this breed. The dog's posture, with its front paws extended forward, suggests it might be in motion or preparing to move quickly.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The dog's coat appears short and smooth, without any visible shedding or undercoat.

The dog's body is elongated, typical of sighthound breeds like Greyhounds or Whippets. Its tail is short and appears to be slightly curved upwards, which is characteristic of these breeds. The tail is dark in color, matching the rest of the dog's body.\n\nThe dog's gait suggests it is moving smoothly and gracefully, consistent with the breed's athletic build. The legs are long and slender, ending in small paws that are visible in the image. The dog's posture indicates it is alert and attentive, possibly looking at something off-camera.\n\nThe dog's ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to the overall sleek appearance.
