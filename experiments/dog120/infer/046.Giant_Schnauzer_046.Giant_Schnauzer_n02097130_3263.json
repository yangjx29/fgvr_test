These include the broad, square-shaped face, short sturdy snout, and the thick, shaggy black coat. The small, triangular, upright ears also align with the breed's typical appearance. The similarity scores provided by the search suggest that the dog does not closely match other breeds like the Norwich Terrier, Toy Terrier, Dandi Dinmont, Lhasa, or Rottweiler, further supporting the classification as a Standard Schnauzer. | Key Features: Broad, square-shaped face, short sturdy snout, thick shaggy black coat, small triangular upright ears, and the dog's overall robust and sturdy build. | Uncertainty: While the dog's features strongly suggest a Standard Schnauzer, there could be slight variations in the breed that might lead to a lower confidence score if more specific traits were considered.
