The thick, wavy, and shaggy black coat with brown markings around the muzzle and chest is a defining feature of the Gordon Setter.

Its ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to its distinctive look. The overall shape of the dog is robust and sturdy, typical of breeds designed for hunting or working purposes.\n\nUnique features include the long, flowing hair that covers the face and body, which could be indicative of a breed known for such characteristics, such as a Gordon Setter.
