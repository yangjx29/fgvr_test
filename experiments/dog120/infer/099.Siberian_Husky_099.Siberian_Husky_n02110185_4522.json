The texture looks soft and slightly shaggy, adding to the overall appearance of the dog.\n\n- **Patterns**: The black fur covers most of the body, with white patches strategically placed to create a unique and recognizable pattern. The white markings are not uniform; they vary in shape and size, contributing to the individuality of each dog.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: While the exact size cannot be determined from the image alone, the dog appears to be medium-sized, consistent with the build of a Husky. The proportions suggest a sturdy yet agile frame.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are pointed and stand upright, which is a hallmark of Huskies.
