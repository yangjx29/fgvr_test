The coloration, with a predominantly white coat and large patches of brown and black, is also consistent with the typical color patterns seen in Basset Hounds. While there are some similarities to Beagles, such as the facial structure and coloration, the long, floppy ears and overall body type are more indicative of a Basset Hound. The similarity scores further support this classification, with Basset Hound having the highest score among the candidates. | Key Features: Compact and low-to-the-ground build, short muzzle, long floppy ears, and distinctive coloration with large patches of brown and black on a predominantly white coat. | Uncertainty: The dog's facial structure, while not as pronounced as in a pure Beagle, still leans towards Basset Hound characteristics.

They are predominantly brown with white markings, particularly around the edges and tips. The texture appears soft and slightly wrinkled, typical of Basset Hounds. The ears are large in proportion to the head and extend far beyond the length of the face, adding to their distinctive appearance. There are no sharp points; instead, they are rounded at the tips. The inner ear is not visible, but the outer surface shows a mix of brown and white fur, with some darker brown areas near the base.

            "The dog in the image exhibits a distinct facial structure characteristic of a Beagle. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The dog has a predominantly white coat with brown and black markings. The fur appears soft and slightly wavy, typical of Beagles. The brown patches are primarily on the ears, face, and back, while the white is prominent on the chest and neck.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The muzzle is narrow and elongated, tapering to a point, which is a key feature distinguishing Beagles from other hound breeds. The eyes are dark and expressive, set in a triangular shape that complements the pointed muzzle. The ears are long, floppy, and hang down close to the ground, adding to the Beagle's distinctive look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The pointed muzzle is the most defining feature, setting it apart from other breeds like Basset Hounds, which have shorter, broader muzzles. The combination of the long, droopy ears and the narrow muzzle further emphasizes the Beagle's unique facial structure.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The dog's face shows some signs of aging, as indicated by the slight discoloration around the muzzle and the visible age spots on the white fur.",
