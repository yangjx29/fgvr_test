The brindle pattern on the face, particularly around the eyes and muzzle, is also a hallmark of the Boxer breed. The overall size and body structure further align with the typical Boxer physique.

The ears are large, floppy, and hang down close to the head. The eyes are dark and expressive, giving the dog an alert appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most noticeable feature is the brindle pattern on the face, which is characterized by a mix of dark and light stripes. This pattern is not uniform across the face but is more prominent around the eyes and muzzle. The nose is black, and the mouth is closed, showing no visible teeth.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's body is muscular and compact, consistent with the Boxer breed's build. The collar is visible, indicating it is a pet, but it does not obscure any significant features.\n\nThese characteristics collectively help distinguish the dog as a Boxer, setting it apart from other breeds with similar white coats and brown markings.",
