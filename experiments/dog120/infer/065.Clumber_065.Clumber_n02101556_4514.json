The vests appear to be made of a quilted material, likely synthetic, with a brownish tone and a slightly textured surface. They have a diamond-shaped pattern typical of quilted designs.\n\n- **Color**: The vests are primarily brown with a subtle sheen, suggesting a synthetic fabric like polyester or nylon. There is no significant variation in color across the vests.\n- **Texture**: The surface has a quilted texture, indicating padding and insulation, which is common in vests designed for warmth or protection.\n- **Shape and Size**: Both vests are cut similarly, with a straight bottom edge and a rounded top. They cover the torso and extend slightly below the waist. The size appears to fit the individuals comfortably, neither too loose nor too tight.\n- **Unique Features**: The vests have a distinct quilted pattern, which sets them apart from plain or solid-colored vests. The material's sheen adds a slight reflective quality under certain lighting conditions.\n- **Special Characteristics**: The vests seem to be designed for practical use, possibly for outdoor activities where warmth and durability are important.
