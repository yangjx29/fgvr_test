The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to its alert expression.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's fur is particularly notable for its length and density, especially around the face and neck area. The ears are long and floppy, framing the face nicely. The overall shape of the dog is compact and sturdy, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The dog's coat has a slight gradient, with lighter fur on the chest and legs and a bit more depth of color on the back and head.
