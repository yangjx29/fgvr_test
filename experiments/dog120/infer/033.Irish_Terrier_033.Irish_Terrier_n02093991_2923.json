The compact and sturdy build, short legs, and the distinctive triangular, upright ears are prominent features. The light brown coat with a darker face and ears is also typical of the Border Terrier.

The similarity score of 0.3438 for Border Terrier is significantly higher than other breeds listed, reinforcing the accuracy of this classification. | Key Features: ['Compact and sturdy build', 'Short legs', 'Triangular, upright ears', 'Light brown coat with darker face and ears', 'Slightly wrinkled forehead and short muzzle'] | Uncertainty: ['While the similarity scores provide strong support, slight variations in coat color or other minor details could potentially lead to a slight uncertainty.']",

The eyes are dark and expressive, giving the dog an alert and attentive look. The nose is black and small, typical of many terrier breeds. The ears are triangular and stand upright, which is characteristic of the Border Terrier breed. The overall facial structure is compact and rounded, with a strong jawline. The dog's expression is calm yet curious, and it seems to be looking directly at the camera. The fur around the eyes is slightly darker, creating a masked effect, which is common in terriers. The dog's overall appearance suggests it could be a Border Terrier, known for its distinctive facial features and alert demeanor.",
            "The image shows a small dog lying on a tiled surface. Here's a detailed description focusing on the body shape and size:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a light brown coat with a slightly darker shade around its face and ears. The fur appears soft and short, with a natural, untrimmed look.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks smooth and well-groomed, without any visible shedding or mats.\n- **Patterns**: There are no distinct markings or patterns on the dog's coat; it is uniformly colored.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact and sturdy build, typical of a terrier breed. Its body is relatively small, with a broad chest and a short back. The legs are short and strong, contributing to its overall robust appearance.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog has a distinctive facial structure with a slightly wrinkled forehead and a short muzzle. Its ears are triangular and stand upright, adding to its alert expression.\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog is wearing a teal collar, which contrasts nicely with its light brown fur. The collar suggests it is a pet.\n\nThese features collectively indicate that the dog is likely a terrier breed, possibly an Irish Terrier, given its coloration and facial structure.",
