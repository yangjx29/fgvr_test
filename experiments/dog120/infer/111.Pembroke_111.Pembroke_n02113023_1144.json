The compact, sturdy build, short legs, and long body are typical of this breed. The light brown coat with white markings on the chest and face, along with the pointed and upright ears, further support this identification. The facial structure, including the dark eyes and the white stripe down the center of the face, aligns closely with the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. The similarity scores also indicate a high likelihood of this being a Pembroke, as it ranks first among the candidates. | Key Features: ['Compact, sturdy build', 'Short legs and long body', 'Light brown coat with white markings', 'Pointed and upright ears', 'Dark eyes and white stripe down the center of the face'] | Uncertainty: ['While the image provides strong evidence for the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, there could be slight variations in other breeds that share some similarities, such as the Cardigan Welsh Corgi.']",
