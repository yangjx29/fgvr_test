There are no visible white markings, which is typical for a Groenendael.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks thick and dense, characteristic of the breed, providing excellent protection against the elements.\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large, triangular, and stand erect, which is a key feature of the Groenendael breed. They are proportionate to the head and not overly floppy.\n- **Facial Markings**: The face is broad with a strong jawline, and the eyes are dark and expressive, giving the dog an alert and intelligent appearance. The muzzle is slightly longer than the skull, and the nose is black.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression is calm yet attentive, with a slightly open mouth showing a pink tongue, suggesting it might be panting or relaxed. The overall build is muscular and well-proportioned, typical of working dogs.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the dog as a Groenendael, setting it apart from other breeds with similar black coats.",
