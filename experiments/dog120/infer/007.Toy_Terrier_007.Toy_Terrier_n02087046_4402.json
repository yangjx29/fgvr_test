Here's a detailed description focusing on its body proportions and build:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly white coat with some black markings. The black markings are primarily on the head, ears, and tail tip, creating a contrast against the white fur.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur appears short and smooth, typical of Rat Terriers. There are no visible patterns other than the natural coloration mentioned above.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small in stature, consistent with the breed standard for Rat Terriers. Its body is compact and muscular, with a slightly elongated head and a sturdy build. The legs are proportionate to the body, and the tail is short and curled over the back.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's ears are erect and pointed, which is characteristic of the breed. The facial markings include a black mask around the eyes and a black nose, adding to its distinctive appearance. The overall shape of the head is elongated, with a strong jawline.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: Rat Terriers are known for their intelligence and agility.

The texture seems smooth and short-haired.\n- **Shape and Size**: The tail is small and compact, fitting the overall small stature typical of toy breeds. The ears are medium-sized compared to the head, standing erect and alert.\n- **Unique Features**: The pointed ears and the short, sturdy build are distinctive traits. The black markings on the face and ears add contrast to the white fur.\n- **Variations**: The dog's coat appears to be short and smooth, without any visible long hair or thick undercoat. This could suggest it is a purebred or well-groomed mixed breed within the toy dog category.\n\nThese characteristics help distinguish the dog from larger breeds or those with longer coats."
