The facial features, such as the black nose and dark eyes, are consistent with the Kuvasz breed. Additionally, the floppy ears and overall calm demeanor further support this classification. While the dyeing makes it difficult to assess some finer points, the general physical traits strongly suggest a Kuvasz. | Key Features: ['Large and robust size', 'Thick, fluffy white coat', 'Black nose and dark eyes', 'Floppy ears'] | Uncertainty: ['The dyeing of the coat makes it challenging to assess certain breed-specific features accurately.']",

The dye appears to be applied in patches, giving the dog a colorful yet somewhat patchy appearance.\n\nThe dog's body is robust and well-built, typical of breeds like Great Pyrenees or Maremma Sheepdogs, which are known for their large size and thick coats. Its ears are floppy and hang down on either side of its head, and its tail is bushy and slightly curled at the end. The dog is wearing a blue harness with a leash attached, indicating it is being walked or led.\n\nThe background consists of grass, suggesting an outdoor setting, possibly a park or a field.
