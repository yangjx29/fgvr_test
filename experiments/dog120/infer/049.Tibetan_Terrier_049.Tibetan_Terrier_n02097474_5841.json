The ears are medium-sized, slightly rounded at the tips, and hang down close to the head. They have a similar texture to the rest of the fur, maintaining the curly pattern. The face is expressive, with a black nose and dark eyes that stand out against the lighter fur. The overall shape of the face is rounded, contributing to the breed's characteristic friendly expression. The dog's mouth is open, revealing a pink tongue, which adds to the cheerful demeanor. The fur around the face is slightly longer than the body, framing the face nicely. This combination of features—white fur with subtle markings, curly texture, medium-sized ears, and a rounded face—suggests the dog could be a breed such as a Bichon Frise or a similar small, fluffy breed.",
