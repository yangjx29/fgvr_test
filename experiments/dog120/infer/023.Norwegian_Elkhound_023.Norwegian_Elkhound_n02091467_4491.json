The white fur is lighter and contrasts with the gray.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's head is elongated with a broad forehead and a pointed muzzle. The ears are triangular and stand upright, which is characteristic of the breed. The eyes are almond-shaped and dark, giving the dog an alert expression.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's nose is black and relatively small compared to its head. The mouth is open, revealing a pink tongue, which adds to the relaxed appearance. The overall facial structure is narrow and elongated, consistent with the Norwegian Elkhound breed.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the dog as a Norwegian Elkhound, setting it apart from other breeds with similar coloration and ear shapes.",
