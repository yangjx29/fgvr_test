The ears are long and hang down close to the head, and the face has a short muzzle.\n\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - A notable feature of the Rhodesian Ridgeback is the ridge of hair that runs along the back of the neck and down the spine, though it may not be fully visible in this image.\n  - The eyes are almond-shaped and dark, giving the dog an alert and intelligent expression.\n  - The nose is black, and the mouth is slightly open, revealing a bit of the teeth, which is common in dogs when they are relaxed.\n\nThese characteristics collectively help distinguish the dog as a Rhodesian Ridgeback, setting",

The ears are floppy and hang down on either side of its head.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The dog's coat appears to have a slight sheen, suggesting good health and grooming.
