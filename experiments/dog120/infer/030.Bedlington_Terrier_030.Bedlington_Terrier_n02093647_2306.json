The ears are floppy and hang down close to the sides of the head, adding to the breed's distinctive look. The eyes are dark and expressive, giving the dog an alert and intelligent expression. The overall shape of the face is rounded, with a slightly elongated snout. The size of the face relative to the body suggests it is a medium-sized dog. The unique features include the curly coat, the floppy ears, and the overall gentle expression.

This coloration is characteristic of the breed.\n- **Texture**: The fur is thick, curly, and dense, giving it a sheep-like appearance. This texture is a key identifier for the Bedlington Terrier.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is compact and well-proportioned, with a sturdy build. The head is small in proportion to the body, with a slightly rounded skull and a short muzzle.\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the curly, sheep-like fur, which covers the entire body, including the face and ears. The ears are long and floppy, adding to the unique look.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: Bedlington Terriers often have a \"wet\" or \"sheepdog\" look due to their dense, curly fur. They typically have a friendly expression and a confident demeanor.\n\nThese characteristics collectively help distinguish the Bedlington Terrier from other breeds, making it easily recognizable.",

Here are the details:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly black coat with a white face and a white patch on its chest. The black fur is dense and slightly wavy, giving it a soft, woolly texture.\n- **Texture**: The fur is thick and fluffy, especially noticeable around the ears and body, which adds to the sheep-like look.\n- **Patterns**: The white markings on the face and chest create a striking contrast against the black fur. The face has a symmetrical pattern with a white stripe down the center and white around the eyes and muzzle.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is compact and rounded, typical of the breed. Its head is small and rounded, with a short snout and large, expressive eyes that are dark in color.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are floppy and hang down close to the sides of its head, enhancing its sheep-like appearance.
