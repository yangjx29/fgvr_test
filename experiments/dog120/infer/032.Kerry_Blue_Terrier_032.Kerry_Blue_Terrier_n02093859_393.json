The ears are small, triangular, and stand upright, adding to the distinctive facial structure. The dog's mouth is slightly open, revealing a pink tongue, which suggests it might be panting. The overall size of the head in relation to the body is proportionate, contributing to the dog's compact and sturdy build. The texture of the fur appears dense and slightly rough, which is characteristic of breeds like Kerry Blue Terriers or similar terrier types.",

The texture of the fur around the ears seems slightly more dense compared to the rest of the body, giving them a fuller appearance. The ears are medium-sized relative to the dog's head and face, not overly large but prominent enough to be noticeable. There are no distinctive markings or patterns on the ears; they are uniformly colored and lack any visible variation in texture or coloration. The ears' shape is rounded at the tips, which is typical for many breeds with floppy ears. Overall, the ears contribute to the dog's expressive and somewhat endearing look.",

The texture is thick and curly, giving it a dense, woolly appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is thick and wavy, with a noticeable sheen that reflects light, indicating good health and proper grooming.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact, sturdy build with a medium-sized frame. Its body is slightly longer than tall, with a broad chest and a strong, muscular back. The legs are short and sturdy, contributing to its overall robust appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - **Head**: The head is broad with a slightly rounded skull, and the ears are small, triangular, and set high on the head, often folded over.\n  - **Muzzle**: The muzzle is short and strong, with a black nose and dark eyes.\n  - **Tail**: The tail is short and carried low, often curled over the back.\n\n- **Distinctive Characteristics**: The Kerry Blue Terrier is known for its unique coat color"
