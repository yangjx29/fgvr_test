They are triangular in shape and point upwards, giving the dog an alert expression.\n  - **Face**: The face is expressive, with dark, almond-shaped eyes that are set wide apart. The white fur around the eyes creates a mask-like appearance, which is common in Shelties.\n\n- **Distinctive Markings**: The white fur around the eyes and the brown patches on the back and tail are key identifying features.
