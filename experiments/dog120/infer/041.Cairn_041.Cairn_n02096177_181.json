The legs are short and sturdy, supporting the dog's compact frame.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog has a distinctive facial expression with a slightly open mouth, showing its tongue, which suggests it might be panting or excited. Its ears are upright and pointed, adding to its alert appearance.

Here are the visual characteristics of the tail:\n\n- **Color**: The tail appears to be a light brown color, matching the overall coat of the dog.\n- **Texture**: The fur on the tail looks soft and slightly wavy, consistent with the texture of the dog's coat.\n- **Shape and Size**: The tail is relatively small compared to the body, which is typical for many terrier breeds. It is not bushy or overly long, maintaining a compact shape.\n- **Unique Features**: The tail is upright and slightly curved, which could suggest the dog is in motion or excited. This posture is often associated with breeds that are active and playful.\n\nThese characteristics help distinguish the tail from other breeds, particularly those with more bushy or curled tails, such as Poodles or Bichon Frises.
