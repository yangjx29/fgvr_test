Here are the key visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The fur is a rich, reddish-brown with a slightly darker shade around the muzzle and ears. The texture appears soft and fluffy, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is thick and dense, giving it a plush appearance. The texture is smooth and not overly coarse, which is characteristic of the Chow Chow's coat.\n\n- **Patterns**: There is a distinct black mask-like marking around the eyes and mouth, which is a hallmark feature of the breed. This pattern contrasts sharply with the lighter fur on the rest of the face.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is large in proportion to the body, with a broad forehead and a short, square muzzle. The ears are small and rounded at the tips, set high on the head. The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to the distinctive look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The black mask around the eyes and mouth is the most distinctive feature, setting the Chow Chow apart from other breeds.
