There is a subtle variation in the shade of brown across the dog's body, with some areas appearing slightly lighter or darker than others, creating a natural, mottled effect.\n\nThe dog's ears are long and floppy, hanging down on either side of its head, adding to its expressive appearance. The fur around the eyes is slightly darker, giving a gentle contrast against the lighter fur on the face. The dog's muzzle is a lighter shade compared to the rest of its body, and there is a hint of white fur near the mouth area, which is a common feature in many breeds.\n\nThe dog is wearing a blue collar with a leash attached, which is visible in the foreground. The collar and leash add a pop of color to the predominantly brown fur. The overall appearance of the dog is healthy and well-maintained, with no visible signs of shedding or mats in the fur.
