There are some lighter patches around the neck and chest area, which contrast with the darker fur.\n\nThe dog's coat is relatively short, not overly long, and seems to be well-groomed. The texture suggests it might be a breed known for a sturdy, compact build, such as a Terrier. The ears are pointed and stand upright, adding to the alert expression of the dog. The tail is short and curled upwards, typical of many Terrier breeds.\n\nThe dog's overall size is small, consistent with a breed like an Australian Terrier or a similar small-sized Terrier.
