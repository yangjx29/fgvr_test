Its posture is relaxed, sitting on all fours with its front legs straight and its back legs slightly bent. The puppy's head is proportionally large compared to its body, a characteristic often seen in young dogs. The ears are floppy and hang down on either side of its head, adding to its endearing look.\n\nUnique features include the puppy's light blue eyes and the contrast between the white and brown fur.
