The fur around the eyes and muzzle is slightly darker, creating a contrast.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur appears slightly rough and textured, suggesting it might be a breed with a wiry coat. There are no distinct patterns, but the fur has a natural, slightly uneven texture that adds to the dog's unique appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are medium-sized and triangular in shape, standing upright. They have a fluffy texture, which is consistent with the overall fur pattern. The ears are proportionate to the head, neither too large nor too small.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's fur looks somewhat unkempt, giving it a scruffy look. This could be intentional for certain breeds or due to the dog being in a relaxed state.
