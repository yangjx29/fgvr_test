There are no visible patterns other than the natural color variation within the coat.\n\n- **Shape and Size of Ears**: The Briard's ears are large, floppy, and hang down close to the sides of the head. They are not as tightly curled as those of a Poodle but are still quite prominent and add to the dog's overall appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Briard's face is broad, with a strong jawline and a slightly wrinkled forehead. The eyes are expressive and dark, and the nose is typically black. The dog's expression in the image shows a happy demeanor, with its mouth open and tongue slightly out.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the Briard from breeds like Poodles, which have a more compact body, shorter fur, and different ear shapes.",
