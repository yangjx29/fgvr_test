The ears appear to be medium-sized, neither too long nor too short, and they are positioned towards the top of the head, slightly angled forward.

Its eyes are almond-shaped, medium-sized, and appear alert and expressive. They have a light brown color with a subtle hint of hazel, which is consistent with the overall coloration of its coat. The texture of the fur appears smooth and well-groomed, without any visible patterns other than the natural variation in color.\n\nThe dog's ears are pointed and stand upright, indicating attentiveness. The eye size is proportionate to the head, neither too large nor too small, contributing to an overall balanced appearance. There are no noticeable unique markings or distinctive features on the eyes themselves, such as spots or additional colors, which helps in distinguishing them from other breeds. The dog's expression seems friendly and energetic, suggesting a lively and alert demeanor.",

Its coat is a light tan color with a smooth texture, and there are no distinct patterns or markings visible on the body. The dog's ears are pointed and stand upright, indicating alertness. The tail is positioned high and slightly curved, suggesting it might be mid-movement or excited.\n\nThe dog's facial features include a black nose and dark eyes, which contrast nicely with its lighter fur. The mouth is open, revealing a pink tongue, which could indicate the dog is panting or happy. The overall appearance suggests a healthy and active dog, possibly a mix breed given the lack of specific breed characteristics.
