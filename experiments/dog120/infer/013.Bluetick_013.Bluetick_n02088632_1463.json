The fur appears short and smooth, with some slight variation in texture, especially around the ears which have a slightly longer, softer appearance.\n\nThe dog's ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to its expressive look. The eyes are dark and alert, giving it an attentive expression. The overall shape of the dog is medium-sized, with a sturdy build and a tail that curls upwards at the end. The dog stands on a patterned rug, which contrasts with its coat color, making it stand out more prominently. The background includes a bookshelf filled with books, suggesting an indoor setting.",

The tail is short and curled upwards at the end. The dog stands on a patterned rug, which contrasts with its speckled coat. The background includes a wooden floor and a bookshelf filled with books, providing context for the setting.",

It has a light grayish-brown color with some darker gray or black markings, giving it a mottled appearance. The texture seems smooth, and there are no visible patterns other than the natural variation in color. The tail is relatively small compared to the body, which is typical for many breeds. There are no unique or distinctive features such as tufts of fur or a bushy tip; it is simply a short, light-colored tail."
