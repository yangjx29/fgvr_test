Here are the breed-specific features observed:\n\n- **Color**: The dog is predominantly white with some light brown markings around the eyes and muzzle. This coloration is characteristic of the breed.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks thick, dense, and slightly wiry, which is typical for Westies. It has a soft, fluffy appearance overall.\n- **Patterns**: There are distinct light brown markings around the eyes and on the muzzle, which contrast with the white fur. These markings are often referred to as \"ticking\" and are a hallmark of the breed.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's head is small and compact, with a square shape. The ears are large, upright, and triangular, standing alertly on top of the head. The eyes are dark and expressive, giving the dog an alert and intelligent look.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's facial expression appears calm and slightly sleepy, with its eyes partially closed. The ears are perked up, indicating attentiveness.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the dog as a West Highland White Terrier, setting it apart from other breeds with similar white coats.",
            "The image shows a small white dog with a fluffy coat, lying on a red plaid blanket. The dog's fur is predominantly white with some light brown markings around its muzzle and paws. The texture appears soft and slightly shaggy, typical of breeds like West Highland White Terriers.\n\nThe dog's body is compact and rounded, with a short, sturdy build. Its ears are triangular and stand upright, adding to its alert appearance. The dog is wearing a red bandana with a patterned design, which contrasts nicely with its white fur. The tail is not visible in the image, suggesting it may be tucked underneath the dog's body or out of frame.\n\nThe dog's size relative to the blanket indicates it is a small breed, likely weighing between 10-20 pounds. The plaid blanket has a vibrant red base with green, black, and white stripes, providing a warm and cozy backdrop for the dog. The overall scene conveys a sense of comfort and relaxation.",
            "The dog in the image appears to be a West Highland White Terrier (Westie). Here's a detailed description focusing on its fur texture and color:\n\n- **Color**: The dog's fur is predominantly white, which is characteristic of the breed. There may be some subtle brown markings around the muzzle and paws, which is common in Westies but not always present.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is short, dense, and wiry, giving it a distinctive look. This texture is essential for the breed as it helps repel water and dirt, making it ideal for their outdoor activities.\n\n- **Patterns**: The fur is smooth and even, without any significant patterns other than the natural variation in color. The white fur is uniform across most of the body, with the brown markings providing contrast.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact, sturdy build typical of terriers. Its head is small with a slightly rounded top, and the ears are small and erect. The overall size is relatively small compared to larger breeds.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog is wearing a red bandana, which adds a pop of color to the otherwise white fur. The bandana is tied around its neck, which is a common accessory for pets.\n\n- **Variations"
