The tail is bushy and stands upright, a common trait in Huskies.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The dog's body is medium-sized, with a sturdy build and a broad chest. Its head is large compared to its body, with pointed ears and almond-shaped eyes that are often blue or multi-colored. The legs are strong and muscular, suitable for running and endurance.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most noticeable feature is the dog's facial expression, which can appear alert and intelligent. The eyes are expressive and can be one color (heterochromia) or two different colors, a characteristic often seen in Huskies. The tail is another distinctive feature, often curled over the back when at rest.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: Huskies come in various color combinations, including black, red",

Here's a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The tail has a mix of light brown and white fur, with the white fur appearing more prominent near the base and blending into the brown towards the tip.\n- **Texture**: The fur appears thick and fluffy, typical of breeds like Huskies, which have double coats for insulation against cold weather.\n- **Patterns**: There are no distinct patterns visible on the tail; the color gradient is smooth, transitioning from white to brown.\n- **Shape and Size**: The tail is relatively long compared to the dog's body, with a broad base tapering to a point at the tip. It is curved upwards, giving it a bushy appearance.\n- **Unique Features**: The tail's position and fluffiness are characteristic of breeds like Huskies, which often have tails that are raised when they are active or excited.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the tail as belonging to a Husky or a similar breed known for such tail characteristics."
