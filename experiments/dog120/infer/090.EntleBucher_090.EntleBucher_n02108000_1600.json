There are also some tan markings on the legs and around the eyes, adding to the breed's unique pattern.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's head is relatively small compared to its body, with a broad forehead and a slightly elongated snout. Its ears are triangular and stand upright, contributing to its alert expression.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, enhancing its attentive demeanor. The overall shape of the head and the proportionate size of the ears relative to the head are characteristic of the Entlebucher Sennenhund.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the dog from other breeds, making it easily recognizable as an Entlebucher Sennenhund.",
