Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The dog has a predominantly black coat with white markings on its chest, legs, and part of its face. The fur appears smooth and short, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is small and elongated, with large, pointed ears that stand upright. The eyes are dark and expressive, and the snout is short and slightly upturned, which is characteristic of the breed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the combination of the black and white coloration, particularly around the face and neck. The ears are large and erect, adding to the alert appearance. The overall head shape is narrow and elongated, consistent with the breed standard.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: Toy Fox Terriers are known for their fox-like expression and compact build. This dog exhibits these traits well, with a lively and attentive demeanor suggested by its open mouth and wide eyes. The white markings on the face can vary in pattern, but this one displays a clear contrast between the black and white areas.\n\nThis description should help distinguish this dog from other breeds with similar small sizes",

The black markings include a solid black face, which extends down the center of the chest and onto the front legs. The ears are large and pointed, standing upright, which is characteristic of certain toy breeds like the Rat Terrier.\n\nThe dog's body is compact and well-proportioned, consistent with the build of a toy breed. Its head is small relative to its body, with a short muzzle and expressive eyes. The dog's mouth is slightly open, revealing a pink tongue, giving it an alert and friendly expression.\n\nThe overall appearance suggests that this could be a Rat Terrier puppy, known for their energetic and playful nature. The combination of the white and black coat, along with the pointed ears and compact body, are distinctive features that help distinguish this dog from other similar breeds.",
