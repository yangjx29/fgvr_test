The light beige coat with darker markings around the eyes and ears is typical of the breed. The compact and rounded body, short sturdy legs, and fluffy tail are also indicative of a Japanese Spaniel. The posture, with one front paw raised, adds to the playful and attentive nature often seen in this breed.
