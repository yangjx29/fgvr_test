The distinctive features such as the elongated head, narrow snout, and long droopy ears further support this identification. The similarity scores indicate that other breeds like the Standard Poodle, Borzoi, and West Highland White Terrier have lower scores, confirming the Italian Greyhound as the most accurate category. | Key Features: Elongated bodies, slender builds, long legs, smooth short coat, white stripe down the back, white underbelly, and the typical sleek and athletic build of Italian Greyhounds. | Uncertainty: There are no significant uncertainty factors affecting the classification.
