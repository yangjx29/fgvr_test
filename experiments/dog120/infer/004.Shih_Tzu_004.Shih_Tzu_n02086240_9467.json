The eyes are dark and expressive, adding to the dog's endearing look. The nose is black, and there is a hint of light brown or tan fur around the mouth area, which contrasts nicely with the white fur. The dog appears to be sitting on a dark-colored surface, possibly carpet, which makes the lighter fur stand out more prominently.
