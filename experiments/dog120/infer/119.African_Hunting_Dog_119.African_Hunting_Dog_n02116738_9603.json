The ears are large and pointed, standing upright, and the tail is bushy with a white tip.\n\nThe size of the African Wild Dog is medium to large, with a robust build. The legs are relatively short compared to its body length, and the paws are large and padded for walking over rough terrain. The overall shape is elongated, with a muscular yet agile body suited for both running and endurance.\n\nUnique features include the striking coat pattern, which serves as camouflage in their natural habitat. The white tip on the tail is particularly distinctive and aids in communication within the pack. The African Wild Dog's coat also shows some variation in color intensity and pattern, which can be influenced by factors such as age, sex, and individual genetics.",
