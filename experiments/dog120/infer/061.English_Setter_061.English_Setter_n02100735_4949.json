The fur appears smooth and slightly wavy, especially noticeable around the ears and tail.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The legs are long and slender, with visible tendons and muscle definition, indicating a lean and athletic build. The paws are small and rounded, consistent with the breed's overall proportions.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to its elegant appearance. The tail is long and bushy, which is another hallmark of the English Setter breed.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The dog's coat shows a mix of white and black, with some areas appearing more densely spotted than others. This variation in pattern is common within the breed and adds to its individuality. The dog's expression is alert and energetic, suggesting it is in motion, possibly running or playing.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the English Setter from other breeds, particularly those with shorter legs or different coat patterns."
