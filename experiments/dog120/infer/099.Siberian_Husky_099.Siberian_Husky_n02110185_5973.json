Here's a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly gray coat with white markings on its chest, face, and paws. There is also a darker gray or black patch around its eyes and ears, creating a striking contrast against the lighter fur.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur appears thick and dense, typical of Huskies, providing insulation and protection. It looks slightly wet due to the water, indicating recent activity in the stream.\n\n- **Patterns**: The dog exhibits a classic \"mask\" pattern on its face, where the darker fur around the eyes and ears contrasts sharply with the lighter fur on the rest of its face. This is a common feature in many wolf-like breeds.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a medium to large build, consistent with Huskies, which are known for their sturdy yet elegant frames. Its legs are long and muscular, suitable for running and endurance activities. The head is broad with pointed ears, another characteristic of the breed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears stand upright, alert, and attentive, which is a hallmark of Huskies.
