There are no distinct markings or patterns on the face itself, but the contrast between the darker and lighter fur creates a natural, elegant look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large, upright, and slightly rounded at the tips. They stand out prominently due to their size relative to the head and the length of the fur. The ears are positioned high on the head and extend outward, framing the face beautifully.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Yorkie's face is expressive, with a small, black nose and dark, alert eyes that give it an intelligent and friendly expression.

The fur is long, silky, and appears well-groomed, giving it a luxurious and fluffy appearance. The texture is smooth and fine, with individual strands visible, which adds to the overall richness of the coat.\n\nThe dog's ears are large and floppy, with the fur extending down to the ground, creating a dramatic effect. The eyes are dark and expressive, framed by the long fur that drapes over them. The snout is short and broad, typical of Yorkshire Terriers, and the fur around the muzzle is slightly shorter and more tightly curled.\n\nThe dog's body is compact and small, consistent with the breed standard for Yorkshire Terriers. The legs are short and sturdy, supporting the dog's weight evenly.
