This ridge is not visible in the image due to the angle and the dog's posture, but it is a defining trait of the breed.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's expression is alert and focused, with a slightly open mouth showing its teeth, suggesting it might be engaged in play or retrieving something.

The dog's body is well-proportioned, with defined muscles visible along its legs and torso, suggesting it is likely a breed known for strength and endurance.\n\nThe dog's ears are medium-sized and set back, with a slightly floppy appearance. Its tail is not fully visible but appears to be short and sturdy. The dog's expression is focused and determined, with its mouth slightly open, showing its teeth as it holds a stick in its mouth. This stick adds an element of playfulness to the scene, emphasizing the dog's active nature.\n\nOverall, the dog's body shape and muscle structure are robust and well-defined, typical of breeds like the Rhodesian Ridgeback, which are known for their athletic build and powerful presence.
