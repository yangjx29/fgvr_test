While the similarity scores suggest other breeds like the Maltese Dog or Pekinese could be close matches, the specific combination of coat texture, color pattern, and facial structure aligns more closely with the Silky Terrier. | Key Features: Thick, fluffy, and slightly shaggy coat; predominantly black with white markings; small, compact size; rounded face; floppy ears | Uncertainty: The similarity scores to other breeds are relatively close, which makes the classification somewhat uncertain.
