These features are consistent with the Walker Hound breed and distinguish it from other breeds like the Beagle, which has a different coat pattern and shorter ears. The similarity score also supports this classification, with the Walker Hound having the highest score among the candidates. | Key Features: Long, floppy ears; tricolor coat pattern (white with black patches); elongated head shape; alert posture. | Uncertainty: While the Walker Hound is the top candidate, there could be slight confusion with the Beagle due to their similar tricolor coat pattern.

The dog's face is mostly white with some black markings around the eyes and nose, giving it a tricolor pattern. The eyes are dark and expressive, and the nose is black. The overall shape of the dog's head is elongated, typical of hound breeds. The dog's posture suggests alertness, and its size relative to the toy indicates it is an adult.

Here are the visual details:\n\n- **Color**: The toy has a light brown body with darker brown accents on the ears and tail. The texture is soft and plush, typical of stuffed toys.\n- **Shape and Size**: The toy is smaller than the real dog, with a compact body and rounded ears. It is proportionally smaller compared to the actual dog, which is standing next to it.\n- **Unique Features**: The toy has a blue collar around its neck, which is a distinctive feature not present on the real dog. Additionally, the toy has a tail that is slightly curved upwards, adding to its lifelike appearance.\n- **Texture**: The toy's fur is smooth and uniform, lacking the varied textures seen on the real dog's coat.\n\nThese features help distinguish the stuffed toy from the real dog, as well as from other types of stuffed animals."
