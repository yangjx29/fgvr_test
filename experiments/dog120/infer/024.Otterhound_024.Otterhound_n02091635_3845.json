There's a subtle variation in tone across the body, giving it a natural, textured appearance.\n\n2. **Texture**: The coat is thick, dense, and wavy, with a noticeable amount of undercoat. This texture is characteristic of Otterhounds, providing insulation and protection against cold water. The fur appears slightly longer and more tousled around the legs and chest, adding to the overall rugged look.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The dog has a medium to large build, with a sturdy yet elegant frame. The head is long and narrow, with a slightly arched back and a deep chest. The tail is long and feathered, extending well beyond the hocks.\n\n4. **Unique Features**:\n   - **Ears**: The ears are long, drooping, and set low on the head, blending into the overall shape of the face.\n   - **Legs**: The legs are strong and muscular, with feathering on the lower legs, which is typical for Otterhounds.\n   - **"
