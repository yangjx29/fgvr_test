The fur appears to be short and slightly wiry, typical of terrier breeds.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is coarse and has a slightly rough texture, which is characteristic of terriers. This contrasts with smoother-furred breeds like spaniels.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are no distinct markings or patterns on the visible part of the dog's face, aside from the natural color variation. The fur appears uniform in texture across the visible areas.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's head is small and rounded, with a pointed snout. The ears are small and stand upright, which is common in terrier breeds. The overall size of the dog suggests it is a small to medium-sized breed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's facial structure includes a strong jawline and a compact nose, which are typical of terriers.
