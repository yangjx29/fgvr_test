There is also a brown patch on its side near the front leg. The ears are long and floppy, characteristic of the breed.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The coat looks smooth and sleek, typical of a Greyhound. The white markings contrast sharply with the black fur, creating a striking pattern. The brown patch adds another layer of color variation.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large and hang down close to the sides of the head, contributing to the dog's elegant appearance. They are proportionate to the rest of the body, which is elongated and narrow.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's face is narrow with a long snout, a common trait in Greyhounds. The eyes are almond-shaped and dark, giving the dog an alert and intelligent expression. The mouth is slightly open, revealing a pink tongue and white teeth, adding to the friendly demeanor.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's overall build is lean and athletic, with a deep",

Here are the visual characteristics that distinguish it:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly black coat with tan markings on its legs, chest, and face. The texture of the fur is smooth and short, typical of sighthounds.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is elongated and slender, with a deep chest and a long neck. Its legs are long and thin, contributing to its streamlined appearance. The overall size suggests an adult dog, standing comfortably on the dock.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are long and drooping, and they hang close to the sides of its head. It wears a red collar around its neck, adding a pop of color against its dark fur. The dog's mouth is slightly open, revealing its teeth, giving it a friendly expression.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's tail is long and bushy, curving upwards at the end. This tail is a distinctive feature often seen in sighthound breeds. The dog's posture is alert and relaxed, indicating it is comfortable and possibly enjoying the outdoor setting.\n\nThese features collectively help",

The texture seems smooth, and the tail is held low and slightly curved, which is characteristic of many sighthound breeds like Greyhounds. The tail's length extends well beyond the dog's body, reaching almost to the end of the dock it stands on. This long, flowing tail is a distinctive feature that helps identify the breed. There are no visible unique patterns or spots on the tail; it maintains a consistent coloration throughout its length.
