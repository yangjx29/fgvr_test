The fur is long and shaggy, especially around the head and neck area, giving it a fluffy appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is thick and soft-looking, with a slightly wavy texture. This is typical for Shih Tzus, which have a luxurious coat.\n\n- **Patterns**: There is a noticeable pattern where the brown and black fur forms a mask-like marking around the eyes, which is characteristic of Shih Tzus. The ears are small and rounded, blending into the fur.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are small and rounded, and they sit close to the head. The overall shape of the head is compact and rounded, consistent with the breed's typical skull structure.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's face is expressive, with a small, dark nose and dark eyes that stand out against the lighter fur. The fur around the face is particularly dense, framing the face in a way that accentuates its features.\n\nThese characteristics collectively help distinguish this dog as a Shih Tzu, setting it apart from other breeds with similar coat",

The legs are short and sturdy, supporting the dog's weight evenly.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's most distinctive feature is its long, flowing fur, which covers its entire body, including the face. This gives it a somewhat shaggy appearance. The ears are not visible due to the abundance of fur covering them. The tail is curled over the back, adding to the overall fluffy look.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The dog's coat seems to be of medium length,",
