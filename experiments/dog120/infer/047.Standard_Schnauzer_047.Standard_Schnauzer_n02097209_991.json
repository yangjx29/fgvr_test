There is also a hint of gray or silver in their fur, especially noticeable on the dog on the far right.\n\n2. **Texture and Patterns**: The fur appears short and dense, giving them a slightly rough texture. Some dogs show subtle variations in coloration, such as lighter patches on their chests or darker areas around their eyes and ears. The texture seems consistent across all dogs, suggesting a uniform grooming style.\n\n3. **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The dogs' ears are of varying shapes and sizes. For example, the dog on the far left has upright, triangular ears, while the dog second from the left has floppy ears that hang down.
