The brown coloration is concentrated around the eyes, ears, and the top of the head, while the black extends down the back of the neck and onto the shoulders. The white fur covers most of the face, including the muzzle and the area around the eyes.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur appears smooth and short, typical of many hound breeds. There are no visible signs of long, floppy ears or a thick, curly coat.\n\n- **Patterns**: The face has a clear contrast between the white and brown/black areas, creating a mask-like pattern around the eyes and ears. This pattern is characteristic of certain hound breeds.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is elongated, which is common in hound breeds, designed for their keen sense of smell and hearing. The ears are medium-sized and hang down close to the head, adding to the overall shape.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression seems alert and attentive, with its ears perked up slightly. The eyes are dark and expressive, contributing to the dog's intelligent appearance.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The dog's",

The dog's body is medium-sized, with a lean yet muscular build typical of hound breeds. Its ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, and it has a red collar around its neck.

The pattern includes a white face with brown markings around the eyes and ears, a black patch over the back, and brown legs.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is medium-sized, typical for a Beagle. Its body is compact and sturdy, with a slightly elongated head and a deep chest. The ears are long and floppy, hanging down close to the cheeks.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's posture is notable; it is sitting upright with one front paw raised, as if reaching out or greeting someone. This behavior is not uncommon in Beagles, which are known for their friendly and curious nature. The red collar adds a pop of color against the dog's coat.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: Beagles often have a tricolor coat (white, black, and brown), which matches the dog in the image.
