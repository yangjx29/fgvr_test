The similarity scores provided by the search also indicate a high likelihood of the dog being a Pomeranian, with the highest score being 0.3387 for Maltese, which is very close but not as distinct as the Pomeranian features. | Key Features: The dog's large, upright ears, fluffy white coat, and overall small size are key features that match the Pomeranian breed. The distinctive ear shape and the alert posture further support this identification. | Uncertainty: While the similarity scores suggest a strong possibility of the dog being a Pomeranian, there could be slight confusion with other breeds like Maltese due to their similar size and coat texture.
