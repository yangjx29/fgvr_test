The texture of the fur is somewhat matted, suggesting it may need grooming. \n\n- **Tail**: The tail is short and appears to be slightly curled upwards, ending in a tuft of hair. It is a lighter shade than the rest of the body, almost white, which contrasts with the gray fur.\n\n- **Legs**: The front legs are straight and appear sturdy, while the back legs are bent at the knees, giving the dog a relaxed posture. The paws are dark gray, contrasting with the lighter fur on the rest of the body. The overall shape of the legs is typical of a standard poodle breed, with a strong bone structure.\n\n- **Color, Texture, and Patterns**: The color is predominantly light gray with subtle variations in tone. The texture is not smooth; there are patches where the fur looks more matted or uneven. There are no distinct patterns, as the fur appears uniformly colored across the body.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The dog's body is proportionate, with a medium build typical of a standard poodle.
