The fur appears thick and slightly coarse, typical of the species' adaptation for warmth and protection.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is medium-sized, with a lean yet muscular build. Its head is elongated with pointed ears, and it has a slender neck supporting a compact body. The legs are long and slender, ending in small, dark paws.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinguishing feature is the irregular, patchy coat pattern, which is unique to African wild dogs. This pattern helps them blend into their natural habitat, providing camouflage against predators and prey.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's tail is bushy and often held upright when alert. Its facial markings include a white stripe running from the nose to the top of the head, which is another characteristic feature of the species.\n\nThese features collectively set the African wild dog apart from other canids, making it easily recognizable.",
