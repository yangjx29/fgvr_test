The fur appears smooth and short.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks soft and well-groomed, with no visible shedding or mats.\n- **Patterns**: There are no distinct patterns on the face itself; however, the dog wears a patterned jacket that covers part of its body, which includes a camouflage design.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is elongated and narrow, typical of sighthound breeds like Greyhounds. The ears are small and pointed, standing upright.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog has a long snout, which is characteristic of sighthound breeds. Its eyes are dark and expressive, adding to its alert expression.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the dog as a sighthound, likely a Greyhound, due to its physical traits and build.",

Here's a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The Whippet has a light gray coat with a darker gray or black saddle marking on its back. The fur appears smooth and short, typical of the breed.\n- **Texture**: The coat looks soft and sleek, with no visible shedding or mats, suggesting good grooming.\n- **Patterns**: The saddle marking is distinct and contrasts sharply with the lighter color of the rest of the body. There are no other notable patterns or markings.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a streamlined body with a long neck and head, characteristic of Whippets. Its legs are long and slender, and it stands on all fours, showcasing its athletic build.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog is wearing a harness with a patterned design, possibly for walking or training purposes. This accessory adds a functional element to its appearance.\n- **Special Characteristics**: Whippets are known for their speed and agility, and this dog's lean physique reflects these traits. The overall posture suggests alertness and readiness.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the Whippet from other breeds, making it easily recognizable.",
