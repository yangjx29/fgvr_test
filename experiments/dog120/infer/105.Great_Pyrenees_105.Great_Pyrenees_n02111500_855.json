The Komondor is known for its distinctive appearance, including a dense, corded coat and a sturdy build, which matches the visual evidence in the image. The similarity score for Komondor is higher than other breeds listed, further supporting this classification. The size and robustness of the dogs also align well with the Komondor's typical physical attributes. | Key Features: Thick, fluffy white coat, broad head, floppy ears, robust build, and corded coat texture visible in parts of the fur. | Uncertainty: While the Komondor is highly likely based on the visual evidence, there could be slight confusion with other breeds like the Great Pyrenees due to their similar appearance.
