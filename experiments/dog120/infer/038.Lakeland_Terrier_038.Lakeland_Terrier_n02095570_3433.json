The ears are medium-sized compared to the dog's head, and they droop down close to the dog's cheeks, adding to its endearing expression. There are no unique markings or patterns on the ears themselves; they are primarily uniform in color and texture. The ears' position and shape are characteristic of breeds like the Wire Fox Terrier, which often have this type of ear structure.",

The fur appears soft and slightly wavy, giving it a textured look.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur is thick and appears slightly shaggy, especially around the neck and chest area where it forms a fluffy mane-like appearance.

Its ears are floppy and hang down close to the face, adding to its endearing appearance. The body is compact, with a strong, muscular build typical of terrier breeds.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog is wearing a bright yellow bandana with star patterns, which adds a pop of color against its fur.
