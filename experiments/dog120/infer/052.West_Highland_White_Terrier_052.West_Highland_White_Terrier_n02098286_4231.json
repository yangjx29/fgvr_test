The texture looks soft and slightly tousled, which is typical for breeds like West Highland White Terriers (Westies).\n- **Patterns**: There are no distinct patterns or markings on the dog's face; it is uniformly white.\n- **Shape and Size**: The face is small and rounded, consistent with the breed's typical features. The eyes are dark and expressive, and the ears are small and folded over.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog has a black nose, which contrasts sharply with its white fur. Its expression seems curious or attentive, with wide, alert eyes.\n- **Distinctive Characteristics**: The dog's fur is particularly noticeable due to its length and texture, which adds to its overall fluffy appearance.\n\nThis description should help distinguish this dog from others, especially those with different fur colors or textures.",

The legs are short and sturdy, and the tail is not visible in the image.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's face is round with large, expressive eyes and a small black nose.
