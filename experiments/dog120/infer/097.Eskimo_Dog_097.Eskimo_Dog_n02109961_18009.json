The fur around the eyes is thick and slightly darker than the rest of the face, creating a mask-like effect.\n\n- **Ears**: The ears are large, triangular, and stand upright, which is a hallmark of the Husky breed. They are covered with soft, fluffy fur that appears light brown or tan in color. The inner part of the ears is lighter, almost white, contrasting with the darker outer fur. The ears are medium-sized relative to the head and are positioned close together, adding to the alert and attentive expression of the puppy.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur on the puppy's face is short and smooth, with a mix of light and dark shades.
