There is no visible ridge (a raised line along the back of the skull), suggesting it may be a smooth-coated breed.

The overall size of the head is proportionate to the body, maintaining balance in the dog's structure.",

Here's a detailed description focusing on the body and legs:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The dog has a predominantly reddish-brown coat with black and white markings. The texture seems smooth and short-haired. The black markings are concentrated around the back, tail, and legs, while the reddish-brown is more prominent on the head, neck, and chest.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a medium to large build, with a strong, muscular frame. Its legs are long and sturdy, indicating good bone density and strength. The body is well-proportioned, with a deep chest and a broad back, typical of hounds designed for endurance and speed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are long and drooping, which is characteristic of many hound breeds. The tail is long and slightly curved upwards, adding to the overall elegant appearance. The dog's posture suggests alertness and readiness, with a straight back and a confident stance.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The dog's coat pattern includes a mix of solid and ticked (small, irregular patches)",

It has a slightly curved shape, tapering towards the end, and appears to have a smooth texture without any visible patterns. The tail is positioned high on the dog's back, extending upwards and slightly outwards, which is typical for many hound breeds. This positioning and shape are distinct and help in distinguishing it from other breeds where the tail might be shorter, thicker, or have different coloration patterns."
