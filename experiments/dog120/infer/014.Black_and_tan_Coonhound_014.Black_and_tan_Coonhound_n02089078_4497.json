This coloration is characteristic of the Doberman Pinscher breed.\n- **Texture**: The surface of the statue has a smooth, polished appearance, suggesting it might be made of stone, metal, or a similar material.\n- **Patterns**: The black coat is solid, while the tan markings are distinct and well-defined, following typical Doberman coloration patterns.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is elongated and narrow, with a slightly pointed snout, which is a common feature of the breed. The ears are long and hang down close to the head, another breed-specific trait.\n- **Unique Features**: The eyes are dark and appear to be deeply set, giving the dog a serious and alert expression.

The overall posture, with the front legs slightly apart and the back legs tucked under, is also typical for a seated dog.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The statue lacks any visible eyes, which might be due to the angle or the nature of the material used.

The ears are dark in color, matching the rest of the coat, and have a soft, slightly rounded shape.

The coat appears smooth and shiny, indicating good health and grooming. The tan markings on the legs and paws are distinct and well-defined, contrasting nicely with the black fur. These markings are often referred to as \"tan points\" and are a common feature in Dachshunds, helping to distinguish them from other breeds.
