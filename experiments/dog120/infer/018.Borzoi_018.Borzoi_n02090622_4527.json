Its ears are long and droopy, characteristic of the breed, and they appear to be slightly darker than the rest of its fur. The dog's face is not fully visible due to its position, but it seems to have a somewhat elongated snout typical of Borzois.\n\nThe dog on the right has a white coat with some light brown or tan markings on its back and legs. Its ears are also long and droopy, similar to the other dog, but they appear lighter in color compared to the first dog. This dog's face is more visible, showing a long, narrow head shape with a slightly darker patch around the eyes and a white muzzle. The overall size and shape of both dogs suggest they are of similar breed and age.\n\nThe unique features of each dog include their coat colors and patterns, which can help distinguish them from one another.
