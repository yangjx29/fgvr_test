The fur is short and smooth, giving it a sleek appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The coat is smooth and does not have the long, floppy ears characteristic of Basset Hounds. Instead, the ears are small and stand upright, though they may have a slightly folded appearance at the tips.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is small and compact, with a short muzzle and a black nose. The eyes are dark and expressive, and the ears are triangular and pointed, standing erect.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the tail, which is curled upwards and over the back, a trait unique to Brussels Griffons. This tail curl is often referred to as a \"dewlap\" and is a key identifier for the breed.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: Brussels Griffons typically have a sturdy build with a compact body and a short, smooth coat. They are known for their alert and intelligent expression, which is evident in the dog's stance and gaze.\n\nThese characteristics clearly differentiate the Brussels Griffon from Basset Hounds,",
