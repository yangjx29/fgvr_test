The brown coloration is most prominent on the ears, back, and tail, while the face and chest are mostly white. The contrast between the two colors is clear and well-defined.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur appears soft and slightly fluffy, typical of the breed. It looks smooth and well-groomed, with no visible shedding or mats.\n\n- **Patterns**: The fur pattern is symmetrical, with a white blaze running down the center of the forehead and continuing onto the chest. The brown fur forms a distinct patch around the eyes and extends down the sides of the face, creating a mask-like appearance. The ears have a darker brown hue compared to the rest of the body, adding depth to the coloration.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The puppy's head is rounded with a slightly elongated snout. The eyes are dark and expressive, giving it an endearing look. The ears are floppy and hang down on either side of the head, framing the face nicely. The overall size of the puppy suggests it is still young, likely",
