The fur appears to be medium-length and slightly wavy or curly, giving it a textured look.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur on the head is soft and appears to have a slight sheen, indicating good health and grooming. The texture is consistent across the head, with no significant variations.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is elongated and narrow, with a slightly rounded forehead. It is proportionate to the body, neither too large nor too small. The ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to the overall balanced appearance.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's head features a distinctively long snout, which is characteristic of terrier breeds.

There are no distinct patterns, but the variation in color and texture adds depth to the coat.\n\nIn terms of shape and size, the dog stands upright, showcasing a sturdy build with a compact body. Its legs are proportionate to its frame, and the tail is not visible in the image. The dog's head is relatively small compared to its body, with a slightly rounded face and a short muzzle. The ears are floppy and hang down close to the sides of the head.\n\nUnique or distinctive features include the dog's overall robust and well-groomed appearance, which suggests it might be a breed known for its thick, textured coat. The dog's stance and posture indicate confidence and alertness. No other dogs or objects are prominently featured in the image, making the focus solely on this particular canine subject.",
