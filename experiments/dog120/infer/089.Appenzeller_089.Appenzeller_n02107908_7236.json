The tail is not fully visible, but it appears to be short and possibly slightly curved, which could suggest a medium-length tail typical of certain breeds like the Beagle or the Jack Russell Terrier. The legs are proportionate to the body, with white paws that extend up the front legs, adding a distinctive contrast against the darker fur.\n\nThe dog's coat seems smooth and short, without any visible long hair or thick undercoat, which might indicate a breed that doesn't shed heavily. The tan markings on the legs and chest are symmetrical and well-defined, suggesting a clear pattern rather than random spots. The overall shape of the dog is compact and sturdy, with a balanced posture that suggests strength and agility.\n\nThe distinctive features include the tan markings on the face, which form a mask-like pattern around the eyes and nose, and the white paws that stand out against the darker fur.
