The texture seems consistent throughout the visible areas of the dog's body.\n\n- **Patterns**: The coat displays a mix of solid white areas and patches of black and gray. The black and gray patches vary in size and shape, contributing to the unique pattern. There are no distinct stripes or spots; instead, the markings are more random and blend into each other.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is medium-sized, and the coat covers most of its visible body parts. The head is proportionate to the body, with a broad forehead and pointed ears.
