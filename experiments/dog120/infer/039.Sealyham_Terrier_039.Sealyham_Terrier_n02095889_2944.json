The ears are large, floppy, and hang down close to the sides of the head.\n\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - The ears are a key distinguishing feature; they are large, floppy, and set low on the head.\n  - The tail is docked, which is a common practice for this breed, though not always visible in the image as it may be tucked between the hind legs.\n  - The dog's posture suggests a confident and alert stance, with a slightly arched back and a head held high.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**:",
            "The dog in the image is a Bedlington Terrier, characterized by its distinctive soft, woolly coat. The fur appears predominantly white with a slightly textured, fluffy appearance, giving it a sheep-like look. The texture is fine and dense, with a slight sheen that highlights the natural curls and waves in the coat. There are no visible patterns other than the natural variations in the fur's density and curling.\n\nIn terms of shape and size, the dog has a compact body with a slightly elongated head and a short, sturdy neck. Its ears are long and hang down close to the sides of the head, adding to the overall gentle and elegant appearance typical of the breed. The tail is short and carried low, blending seamlessly into the body.\n\nUnique features include the dog's alert expression, with perked-up ears and bright, dark eyes that convey intelligence and curiosity. The overall size of the dog is small to medium, with a balanced proportion between the head, body, and legs.\n\nNo variations or special characteristics are immediately apparent beyond the standard Bedlington Terrier traits described above.",
            "The tail of the dog in the image appears to be predominantly white, matching the rest of its fur. It has a fluffy texture, which is consistent with the breed's characteristic coat. The tail is relatively short and curls slightly upwards at the tip, giving it a distinctive shape. This curling pattern is a unique feature often seen in certain terrier breeds, such as the Sealyham Terrier, which this dog resembles.\n\nIn terms of size, the tail is proportionate to the body, neither too long nor too short, maintaining balance with the overall appearance of the dog. There are no visible patterns or markings on the tail; it is uniformly white throughout. The tail's position is upright and slightly curved, indicating alertness and energy, typical behaviors for a terrier breed."
