Its head is large in proportion to its body, with floppy ears and a broad snout. The toy is small compared to the dog, with a shape resembling a small, rounded figure, possibly a toy animal or character, and it has a handle for easy gripping.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's relaxed posture and the presence of the toy suggest playfulness.
