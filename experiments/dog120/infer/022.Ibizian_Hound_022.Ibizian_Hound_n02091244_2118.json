This stripe contrasts sharply with the tan fur around it.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The stripe is straight and narrow, extending from the forehead down to the nose. It is positioned centrally on the face, dividing the tan fur into two equal halves.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The white stripe is a defining feature of this dog's appearance. It is not only a color contrast but also a clear demarcation line across the face.
