The brown fur is prominent on the back and sides, while the white fur covers the chest and parts of the legs. The black fur is seen around the eyes and ears.\n- **Texture**: The fur appears slightly wavy and not overly smooth, suggesting a medium-coarse texture typical of certain terrier breeds.\n- **Patterns**: There are distinct patches of color, with the brown and white fur creating a contrast. The black fur around the face and ears adds definition to the dog's facial features.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is compact and sturdy, indicating a medium build. The legs are short and robust, which is characteristic of terrier breeds. The tail is not fully visible but seems to be of moderate length, ending in a rounded tip.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to its terrier-like appearance.
