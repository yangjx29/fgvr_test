It has a consistent height and width, with a smooth surface.\n- **Color**: The wall is a uniform grayish-brown, typical of concrete or stone construction.\n- **Texture**: The wall's surface looks smooth and slightly rough in places, possibly due to wear or natural weathering.\n- **Patterns**: The wall has a series of vertical grooves or ridges running along its length, adding a subtle texture to its otherwise plain appearance.\n\n### Dogs:\n- **Color and Patterns**: The dogs have a mix of brown, white, and black fur.
