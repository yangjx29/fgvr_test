            "The dog in the image has a thick, shaggy coat with a rich brown and tan coloration. The fur appears dense and somewhat wavy, giving it a textured look. The coat is longer on the body and shorter on the legs, creating a natural contrast in length. The tail is bushy and stands upright, adding to the dog's robust appearance.\n\nThe dog's face is not fully visible due to the angle, but the visible part of the head suggests a broad, sturdy build typical of large breeds. The ears are floppy and blend into the fur, contributing to the overall fluffy appearance. There are no distinct markings or patterns on the visible parts of the dog's body, making the uniform coloration stand out.\n\nThe dog's size is substantial, indicating it is likely a large breed, possibly a Leonberger or a similar type. Its muscular build and the way it carries itself suggest strength and endurance. The dog's expression seems calm and focused, as if it is engaged in an activity like carrying a stick."
