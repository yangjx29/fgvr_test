The nose is dark brown, and the eyes are dark, adding contrast to the lighter fur around them. The overall shape of the head is rounded, typical of many spaniel breeds.

They are rounded at the tips and have a slight curve inward, giving them a gentle, droopy appearance. The size of the ears is proportionate to the rest of the dog's head, neither too small nor too large.
