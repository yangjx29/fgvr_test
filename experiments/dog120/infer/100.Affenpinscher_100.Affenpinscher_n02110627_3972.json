These include the compact and sturdy build, the short back and stocky frame, the thick and wiry dark fur with lighter shades around the face, the small triangular ears that stand upright, and the overall facial structure which is compact and rounded. The similarity scores also suggest that the dog does not closely match other breeds like the Pekinese, Groenendael, Great Dane, Kuvasz, or Tibetan Mastiff, further supporting the classification as an Affenpinscher. | Key Features: Compact and sturdy build, short back, stocky frame, thick and wiry dark fur with lighter shades around the face, small triangular ears that stand upright, and compact, rounded facial structure. | Uncertainty: While the dog's features strongly align with an Affenpinscher, there could be slight variations in size and fur texture that might lead to a lower confidence score if the image were less clear or if the dog were significantly smaller or larger than typical Affenpinschers.",

They appear to be covered with the same dark fur as the rest of the body, without any visible patterns or color variations.

Here's a detailed description focusing on the overall body shape and size:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly dark, almost black coat with some lighter shades visible around the face and possibly on the underbelly. The texture appears slightly rough and shaggy, typical of certain breeds known for their thick fur.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small in stature, likely a toy breed given its compact build and short legs. Its body is relatively stocky, with a short back and a sturdy frame. The head is proportionally large compared to the body, with a broad forehead and expressive eyes.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's most noticeable feature is its upright posture when standing on its hind legs. This stance gives it an alert and curious appearance. The ears are small and pointed, adding to its distinctive look. The facial expression seems attentive, with a slightly open mouth showing its teeth, which could indicate playfulness or excitement.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The dog's fur looks dense and somewhat wiry, suggesting it might be a breed like an Affenpinscher or a Brussels griffon.
