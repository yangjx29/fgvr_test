The tail's shape is rounded at the base and tapers slightly towards the tip, which is a common characteristic of many breeds.\n\nThe dog's coat texture seems soft and slightly rough, typical of breeds like Tibetan Mastiffs, which often have a thick undercoat for warmth. There are no visible patterns other than the natural color variation between the black and brown fur. The size of the tail is proportionate to the dog's body, neither too large nor too small, maintaining balance with the rest of the dog's physique."
