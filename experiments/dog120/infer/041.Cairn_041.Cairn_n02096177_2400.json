            "The dog in the image appears to be an Affenpinscher, characterized by its dense, wiry coat that is typically black with a slightly rough texture. The coat is short and stands up in places, giving it a spiky appearance. The dog's fur is relatively uniform in color, with no visible patterns other than the natural variation in the texture and sheen of the coat. Its ears are erect and pointed, adding to its alert expression. The dog's size is small, consistent with the breed standard for Affenpinschers, which are generally compact and sturdy. The overall shape of the dog is angular and well-defined, with a strong jawline and a muscular build. The dog's eyes are bright and expressive, contributing to its lively demeanor. There are no visible markings or patterns that would suggest it is an Australian Terrier, as the Australian Terrier typically has a more rugged, wire-haired coat that is often longer and more shaggy, especially around the body and legs."
