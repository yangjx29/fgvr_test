Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The dog has a predominantly white undercoat with black patches, particularly around the face, ears, and back. The fur appears thick and slightly shaggy, giving it a fluffy appearance. The texture seems soft and dense.\n\n- **Ears**: The ears are large, upright, and pointed, which is typical for Border Collies. They are black on the outside and have some white fur mixed in, especially near the base. The inner part of the ear is not visible in this image.\n\n- **Fur Pattern**: The black and white pattern is symmetrical, with the black fur forming a distinct \"mask\" around the eyes and extending down the sides of the face. The white fur covers most of the chest and belly area, creating a stark contrast with the black patches.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are relatively large compared to the head, contributing to the dog's alert and attentive expression.

Here are the details:\n\n- **Eyes**: The eyes are almond-shaped with a rich brown color. They appear alert and focused, giving the dog an attentive expression. The fur around the eyes is short and smooth, contrasting with the longer, shaggy fur on the rest of the face.\n\n- **Nose**: The nose is black and appears moist, which is typical for dogs. It is medium-sized and positioned centrally on the face, slightly below the eyes.\n\n- **Facial Texture and Patterns**: The fur on the face is predominantly black around the eyes and ears, with a white stripe running down the center of the forehead and continuing onto the chest. The fur is thick and fluffy, especially around the neck and chest area, creating a soft, textured appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog has a long, shaggy beard-like fur around the mouth, adding to its distinctive look.
