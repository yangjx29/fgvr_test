There is a distinct white stripe running down the center of the forehead and nose.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur appears thick and slightly shaggy, particularly around the neck and chest, giving it a fluffy appearance. The texture seems soft and dense, typical of breeds with long, thick coats.\n\n- **Patterns**: The black and white fur creates a classic bi-color pattern, which is common in many herding dog breeds. The white fur around the eyes and mouth contrasts sharply with the black, making the facial features stand out.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's face is medium-sized with a broad head and a relatively short muzzle.

The fur around the nose is short and smooth, while the fur on the rest of the face is longer and fluffier, especially around the neck area.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The eyes are almond-shaped and relatively large compared to the size of the head. They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the black stripe running down the center of the forehead. The nose is small and rounded, typical of many dog breeds.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog has a distinct black and white coat pattern, which is characteristic of certain breeds like Border Collies.
