The fur appears thick and slightly shaggy, giving it a fluffy appearance. The texture seems soft and dense.\n\n- **Ears**: The ears are large, upright, and pointed, which is typical for Border Collies. They are black on the outside and have some white fur mixed in, especially near the base. The inner part of the ear is not visible in this image.\n\n- **Fur Pattern**: The black and white pattern is symmetrical, with the black fur forming a distinct \"mask\" around the eyes and extending down the sides of the face. The white fur covers most of the chest and belly area, creating a stark contrast with the black patches.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are relatively large compared to the head, contributing to the dog's alert and attentive expression.
