The short, silky coat with a distinct contrast between the darker back and lighter face is a hallmark of the breed.

While the similarity scores suggest other breeds like Norwich Terrier and Australian Terrier could be close matches, the overall appearance aligns more closely with the Silky Terrier. | Key Features: Short, silky coat with a darker back and lighter face; small size; rounded head; upright ears; facial markings around the mouth and chin. | Uncertainty: The similarity scores to Norwich Terrier and Australian Terrier are very close, making it challenging to definitively rule out these breeds.
