Its ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, and it has a compact body typical of the breed.\n\nThe dog on the right seems to be a Foxhound, identifiable by its larger size, longer legs, and a predominantly black and white coat with some brown markings. Its face is mostly black with a white muzzle and a white stripe down the middle, and its ears are also floppy but slightly more upright than those of the Beagle.\n\nBoth dogs exhibit the characteristic alertness and energy associated with hound breeds, which are often used for hunting.
