The ears have a darker brown coloration, which contrasts with the lighter fur on the rest of the head.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is proportionate to the body, with a rounded forehead and a medium-sized snout.

Here’s a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly white coat with brown patches. The brown areas are primarily on the head, back, and legs, creating a brindle pattern.\n- **Texture**: The fur appears soft and slightly damp, as it is in contact with the water.
