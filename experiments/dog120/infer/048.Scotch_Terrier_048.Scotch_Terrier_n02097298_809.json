There is a subtle hint of a reddish-brown coloration around the muzzle and the inner part of the ears.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur appears dense and slightly wiry, which is characteristic of the breed. It is not overly fluffy but rather has a firm, compact quality.\n\n- **Eyes**: The eyes are dark and almond-shaped, giving the dog an alert and intelligent expression. They are set deep within the head, contributing to the breed's distinctive look.\n\n- **Ears**: The ears are large, erect, and triangular, standing upright on the head. They are covered with the same wiry fur as the rest of the body.\n\n- **Snout**: The snout is short and broad, with a slightly curved mouth. The pink tongue is visible, adding a playful element to the dog's appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog is wearing a patterned bandana around its neck, which adds a touch of personality and color contrast against the black fur.

There is a subtle hint of a reddish tint around the muzzle and ears, which is typical for the breed.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur appears dense and wiry, which is characteristic of Scottish Terriers. The texture is rough and not as sleek as some other breeds, contributing to their unique appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's body is compact and sturdy, with a square-shaped head and a short, stocky build. It has a small, rounded head with large, erect triangular ears that stand upright. The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, adding to its alert expression.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the dog's \"tartan\" bow tie, which adds a playful and charming element to its appearance. The bow tie is patterned with red, white, and blue, which contrasts nicely with the black fur.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: Scottish Terriers are known for their terrier-like behavior, including a feisty and independent nature.

Its head is large in proportion to its body, with prominent, erect ears that stand straight up. The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, and its mouth is open with a pink tongue visible, giving it a friendly expression.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog is wearing a red and blue patterned bandana around its neck, adding a pop of color to its appearance.
