The texture appears smooth and short-haired. The dog's ears are floppy and have a mix of brown and white fur, with the brown being more prominent. The tail is not fully visible but seems to be of medium length and possibly curled at the end. The overall pattern is speckled, with the brown spots varying in size and blending into the white background. This speckled pattern is characteristic of certain breeds, such as the Brittany Spaniel, which matches the dog's appearance in this image.",

The tail seems to have a slightly bushy texture, which is typical for breeds like the Brittany Spaniel. There are no distinct markings or features on the tail itself; it blends seamlessly into the dog's body due to its position. The tail's size relative to the dog suggests it is proportionate, neither too long nor too short for the breed.
