The fur appears thick and fluffy, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is dense and wavy, giving it a lion-like appearance. The texture is soft and plush, which is evident from the way the light catches the fur, creating highlights and shadows.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's face is broad and square, with a short, sturdy snout. The eyes are almond-shaped and dark, set deep within the head, contributing to an intense and alert expression. The ears are small, triangular, and stand upright, though they blend into the fur due to the length and density of the coat.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Chow Chow's most notable feature is its blue-black tongue, which is visible when the dog pants.
