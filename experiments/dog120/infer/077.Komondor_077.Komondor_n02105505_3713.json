The eyes are small and dark, partially obscured by the abundant fur, which adds to the dog's distinctive look. The nose is black and contrasts sharply with the white fur. The overall shape of the face is rounded, with a slightly wrinkled forehead due to the weight of the fur. The ears are not visible, likely hidden beneath the dense coat.

This texture is consistent throughout the ears, contributing to their unique look.\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large and floppy, hanging down on either side of the head. They are proportionally large compared to the dog's head, adding to the overall fluffy and voluminous appearance.\n- **Unique Features**: The ears' texture and length are particularly striking. The matted, rope-like strands create a distinctive pattern that sets them apart from other breeds with floppy ears. The ears are not just droopy; they have a fullness and volume that enhances the dog's overall fluffy appearance.\n\nThese characteristics make the ears stand out as a defining feature of this breed, helping to distinguish it from similar categories of dogs.",
