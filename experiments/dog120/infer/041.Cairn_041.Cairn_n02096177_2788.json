Its fur is thick and appears slightly unkempt, which is characteristic of breeds like Cairn Terriers or Skye Terriers. The dog's face is rounded with a short muzzle, and its eyes are a light brownish color, adding to its expressive look. The ears are upright and pointed, contributing to its alert expression. The overall size of the dog seems relatively small to medium, consistent with terrier breeds.

The texture of the fur looks coarse and slightly rough, typical of terrier breeds known for their protective and sturdy build.",

The fur is predominantly grayish-brown with some darker and lighter shades, giving it a textured appearance.\n   - **Snout:** The snout is broad and short, with a dark nose and a mouth that seems to be closed. The fur around the snout is also thick and shaggy, blending into the overall coat.\n\n2. **Background Dog:**\n   - **Ears:** The dog has small, pointed ears that stand upright. The fur on these ears is shorter and smoother compared to the foreground dog, and it appears to be a light beige or cream color.\n   - **Snout:** The snout is small and rounded, with a black nose. The fur around the snout is short and smooth, contrasting with the shaggier fur of the foreground dog.\n\n**Distinctive Features:**\n- The foreground dog's larger, shaggy ears and thick fur give it a more rugged and unkempt look.\n- The background dog's smaller, pointed ears and smooth fur make it appear more compact and well",

Its ears are upright and pointed, and the fur around the eyes is slightly darker, creating a distinct facial pattern.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression seems calm and slightly curious, with its eyes looking directly at the camera.
