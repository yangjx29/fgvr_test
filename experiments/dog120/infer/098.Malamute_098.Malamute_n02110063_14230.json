The undercoat is dense and fluffy, providing insulation, while the outer coat is coarser and more visible. The coloration includes a blend of gray and white on the body, with darker markings around the eyes and ears.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ears are large, triangular, and stand upright, which is characteristic of the breed. They are proportionate to the head and add to the alert expression of the dog.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The eyes are almond-shaped and have a striking blue or multi-colored appearance, often seen in Huskies. This is a unique feature that sets them apart from other breeds.

The texture looks soft and well-groomed.\n\n- **Patterns**: The dog displays a classic \"mask\" pattern on its face, where the fur around the eyes is darker than the rest of the face. This is a common feature in many huskies, enhancing their expressive look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a medium-sized, muscular build with a broad chest and a compact body. Its head is large with pointed ears that stand upright, a trait often associated with the breed.
