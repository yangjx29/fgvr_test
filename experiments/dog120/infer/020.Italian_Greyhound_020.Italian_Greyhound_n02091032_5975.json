The fur appears smooth and short, typical of sighthounds like Greyhounds or Whippets. There is a distinct contrast between the black and white areas, which is visually striking.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The dog's body is long and lean, with a narrow waist and broad shoulders. Its legs are long and slender, contributing to its streamlined appearance. The head is small in proportion to the body, with a narrow muzzle and erect ears, which are common features in sighthound breeds.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's tail is curled upwards, a common posture for alertness or curiosity. The ears are pointed and stand upright, enhancing its attentive expression. The collar and tag suggest it is a pet, but these do not affect the body structure itself.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The dog's build is athletic and muscular, designed for speed and agility.
