The fur is predominantly white, with black and brown markings on the back and tail.

The black fur is concentrated around the eyes, ears, and back, creating a striking contrast against the white. The texture appears soft and fluffy, typical of breeds like Papillons. The ears are large and upright, with a feathery appearance due to their long, flowing fur. The tail is also fluffy and white, adding to the overall elegant look. The dog's face has a friendly expression, with dark, expressive eyes and a slightly open mouth showing a pink tongue, which adds to its charming appearance. The size of the dog is small, consistent with Papillon breed standards. There are no visible variations or special characteristics that stand out beyond the standard Papillon features.",

The texture appears soft and slightly wavy, which adds to the overall fluffy look. The tail is relatively short compared to the dog's body, and it curves upwards, ending in a tuft of white fur that stands out against the darker tips. This tuft is a distinctive feature that helps distinguish the tail from other tails, as it is not common for dogs to have such a prominent, upright tuft at the end of their tail. The tail's coloration and texture contribute to the dog's overall fluffy and well-groomed appearance."
