The overall size of the dog seems moderate, neither too large nor too small, fitting well within the frame held by the person.

The face is expressive, with dark eyes and a black nose, and the fur around the mouth and chin is denser and more textured compared to the rest of the body.\n\nThe dog's size relative to the person holding it suggests it is a medium-sized breed.

Its fur looks thick and slightly shaggy, giving it a fluffy appearance. The dog's ears are floppy and dark, blending into the black fur. The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, and its nose is black.\n\nThe person holding the dog has curly red hair that frames their face. They are wearing a green top with a yellow collar, which adds a pop of color against the natural background. The background consists of green foliage, suggesting an outdoor setting, likely a park or forested area.\n\nThe dog's size relative to the person suggests it is a smaller breed, possibly a terrier or a similar type, given its build and fur texture. The dog's body is compact and sturdy, with a short back and a relatively long head. The overall body shape is rounded and somewhat stocky, typical of many terrier breeds.
