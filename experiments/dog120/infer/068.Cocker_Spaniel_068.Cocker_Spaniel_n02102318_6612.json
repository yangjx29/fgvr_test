The size of the dog also aligns well with typical English Cocker Spaniels, which are generally smaller than some of the other breeds listed. The similarity score for English Cocker Spaniel is higher compared to the other breeds, further supporting this classification. | Key Features: Shaggy coat texture, predominantly black coat with white markings around the muzzle, floppy ears, and the overall size of the dog. | Uncertainty: While the dog shares some similarities with other breeds like the Wheaten Terrier, the combination of the shaggy coat, white markings, and floppy ears strongly suggests an English Cocker Spaniel.
