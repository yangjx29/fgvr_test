These features are distinct from the pug-like dog on the right, which has a smooth, short-haired coat, a compact body, and a flat face with large, expressive eyes. The similarity scores also suggest that the Shetland Sheepdog is the closest match among the given options. | Key Features: Shaggy, long coat; elongated face; smaller, less wrinkled forehead; small, folded-over ears | Uncertainty: While the Shetland Sheepdog is the most likely category based on the visual evidence, there could be slight confusion with other breeds like the Otterhound due to their similar coat textures.
