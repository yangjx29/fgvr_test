Its face is marked with a white blaze running down the center, and it has a white patch around its mouth. The ears are floppy and dark, contrasting with the lighter fur around them.\n\nThe dog in the background appears to be a Greater Swiss Mountain Dog (GSD). It has a tricolor coat pattern, which includes black, tan, and white. The GSD's face is characterized by a white blaze that extends from the forehead down the nose, with a white muzzle and white markings around the eyes. The ears are large, triangular, and hang down close to the head, with a darker coloration compared to the rest of the face. The texture of the coat is thick and slightly rough, typical of the breed.\n\nBoth dogs have distinct facial features that help identify their breeds. The GSD's larger size, broader head, and more pronounced facial markings are key distinguishing features.
