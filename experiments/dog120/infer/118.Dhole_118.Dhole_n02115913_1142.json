The fur is short and dense, giving it a sleek appearance.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur is smooth and glossy, indicating good health. There are no distinct patterns on the body; the coloration is uniform across most of the body, except for the tail which has a darker tip.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dhole has a slender yet robust build, typical of a medium-sized wild canine. Its head is elongated with pointed ears, and its legs are relatively long compared to its body, contributing to an agile and athletic appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is its facial structure, characterized by a narrow snout and large, pointed ears that stand upright.

Its tail is relatively short compared to its body, with a distinct dark brown tip that contrasts sharply with the rest of the tail's reddish hue. The fur on the tail seems smooth and slightly coarse, typical of canids, and there are no visible patterns or markings on it.\n\nThe dhole's posture suggests alertness; its ears are perked up, and its gaze is directed forward, indicating attentiveness to its surroundings. The overall shape of the dhole is lean and muscular, with a long neck and a compact body, which is consistent with its role as a pack hunter. The legs are strong and well-suited for running, and the tail's position, slightly raised, further emphasizes its readiness and focus. This posture and the tail's coloration make it stand out distinctly from other canids like wolves or foxes, which might have more varied tail colors or different tail shapes."
