The snout is short and wide, typical of many terrier breeds, and it appears to have a black nose. The overall facial structure is rounded and compact, with a strong jawline that contributes to the dog's sturdy yet friendly demeanor.

It also features a green mane and a multicolored ball attached to it, which includes red, yellow, blue, and purple sections.\n- **Texture**: The toy seems to have a soft, plush texture typical of stuffed animals.\n- **Shape and Size**: The toy is relatively small compared to the dog, likely designed for a pet like a puppy. It has a rounded head and a small body, consistent with a plush toy.\n- **Unique Features**: The toy has a distinct zebra-like pattern on its body, with black stripes on a pink background. The green mane adds a unique touch, and the multicolored ball attached to it provides an additional point of interest.\n- **Tail**: While not clearly visible in the image, the toy's tail might be part of the body or could be a separate feature, depending on the design.\n\nThese characteristics help distinguish"
