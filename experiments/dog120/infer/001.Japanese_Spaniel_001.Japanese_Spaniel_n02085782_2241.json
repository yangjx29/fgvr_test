The most prominent feature is the black mask-like pattern around its eyes, which extends down to its nose, creating a striking contrast against the white fur. The ears are also black, adding to the mask effect.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur appears soft and fluffy, typical of the breed's characteristic silky texture.

Its ears are large, floppy, and hang down on either side of its face, contributing to its endearing and somewhat delicate look. The overall size suggests it is still young, likely a puppy rather than an adult.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The black mask pattern is a hallmark of the Japanese Chin breed.

The ears are positioned upright and slightly forward, framing the face. They are relatively large compared to the dog's head, which is characteristic of Japanese Chin dogs. The black coloration contrasts sharply with the white fur on the rest of the body, making the ears stand out prominently.
