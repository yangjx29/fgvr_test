The rich, dark reddish-brown coat with a smooth, glossy texture is typical of Vizslas. The almond-shaped eyes, floppy ears, and the overall body shape and size further support this identification. The Vizsla is known for its short, broad muzzle and slightly wrinkled forehead, both of which are present in this dog.
