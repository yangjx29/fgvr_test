The fur appears to be predominantly gray with some black areas, particularly around the eyes and ears. White fur is visible on the tips of the ears and along the neck area.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is thick, curly, and somewhat shaggy, giving it a textured appearance. The curls are tight and dense, contributing to the overall fluffy look.\n\n- **Patterns**: There is a distinct pattern where the fur transitions from darker shades (gray and black) to lighter shades (white). This pattern is most noticeable around the face and neck.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's head is relatively large compared to its body, which is typical for certain breeds. The ears are long and floppy, adding to the overall size of the head. The face is elongated, with a slightly pointed snout.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's fur is quite prominent, covering most of the visible parts of its face and neck.

They have a natural, relaxed shape without any visible folds or creases. The fur around the ears is quite dense, which adds to their prominent and distinctive look. There are no unique markings or spots on the ears; they are uniformly colored with the same blend of gray and light blonde tones throughout.

There are no distinct patterns visible, as the fur is uniformly textured throughout.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog appears to be medium-sized, with a sturdy build. Its head is large in proportion to its body, and the ears are long and droopy, adding to its unique appearance. The overall body shape suggests a robust yet not overly bulky frame.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's most noticeable feature is its long, wavy fur, which covers its entire body.
