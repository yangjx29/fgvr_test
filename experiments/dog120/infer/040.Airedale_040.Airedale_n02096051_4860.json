The light brown and black fur pattern, along with the broad head, strong jawline, and floppy ears, are consistent with the breed. The similarity scores also indicate a high likelihood of the dog being an Airedale Terrier, with the score for Airedale being the highest among the candidates. | Key Features: Medium-sized, robust build; thick, wiry, dense coat with a mix of light brown and black fur; broad head, strong jawline, and floppy ears; facial markings including a white blaze on the chest and lighter fur around the eyes. | Uncertainty: While the dog's features strongly suggest it is an Airedale Terrier, there could be slight variations in appearance due to individual differences within the breed.
