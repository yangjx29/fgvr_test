These include the large, upright, and pointed ears, the long and narrow snout, the smooth and short coat with a predominantly white base and reddish-brown markings, and the docked tail. The overall build and proportions of the dog also match those typically seen in Ibizan Hounds. The similarity scores provided by the similarity search further support this classification, as the Ibizan Hound has the highest score among the candidates. | Key Features: Large, upright, and pointed ears; long and narrow snout; smooth and short coat with white base and reddish-brown markings; docked tail; athletic and slender build. | Uncertainty: While the Ibizan Hound is the top candidate, there could be slight confusion with other breeds like the Blenheim Spaniel due to their similar coat colors and markings.

The coloration is smooth and even, without any visible patterns other than the natural markings.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's ears are large, upright, and pointed, which is characteristic of the breed. They stand out prominently against the dog's head. The eyes are almond-shaped and dark, giving the dog an alert expression. The snout is long and narrow, typical of sighthounds like the Ibizan Hound.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's tail is docked, which is common for this breed. Its body is lean and muscular, designed for speed and agility, further supporting the identification as an Ibizan Hound.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the dog from other breeds, making it clear that it is an Ibizan Hound.",

Its coat appears smooth and short, typical of a sighthound breed. The dog's ears are long and floppy, hanging down close to its head, which is characteristic of breeds like the Ibizan Hound. The dog's build is slender and athletic, with a lean body structure and a long neck, further suggesting it could be an Ibizan Hound. The dog's tail is docked, which is a common practice in some breeds for health reasons. The overall appearance, including the coloration and physical traits, aligns well with the Ibizan Hound breed.",

It seems to have a light brown coloration, which matches the rest of the dog's coat. There are no distinct markings or patterns on the tail that stand out as unique identifiers. The tail's size relative to the body suggests it is proportionate, neither exceptionally long nor short. No special characteristics or variations are apparent from the visible portion of the tail."
