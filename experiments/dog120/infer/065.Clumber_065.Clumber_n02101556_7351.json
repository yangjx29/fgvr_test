The fur covers the entire body, including the head, ears, and legs, with no visible signs of short or sparse patches.\n\nThe dog's ears are floppy and covered in the same long, wavy fur, which drapes over them. The eyes are partially obscured by the fur, adding to the dog's endearing expression. The overall shape of the dog is medium-sized, with a broad chest and a sturdy build. The dog's posture suggests relaxation, lying comfortably on a plaid-patterned cushion.\n\nUnique features include the dog's expressive face, with a slightly open mouth revealing a pink tongue, and the gentle, calm demeanor.
