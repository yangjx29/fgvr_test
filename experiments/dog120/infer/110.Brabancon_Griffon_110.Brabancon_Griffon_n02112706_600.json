The texture is smooth and shiny, typical of the breed.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small in stature, consistent with the Brussels Griffon breed. Its head is large in proportion to its body, with a distinctive \"griffon\" look characterized by a wrinkled forehead and a curled tail.\n\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - **Ears**: The ears are large, upright, and pointed, standing out prominently on either side of the head. They are typically covered with a dense, soft hair that gives them a fluffy appearance.\n  - **Face**: The face is square-shaped with a short muzzle, and the eyes are large and expressive, often giving the dog an alert and intelligent expression.\n  - **Tail**: The tail is curled over the back, which is a hallmark of the breed.\n\n- **Distinctive Characteristics**: The dog's facial features, including the large, expressive eyes and the characteristic griffon look, are key identifiers for the Brussels Griffon breed.

Here's a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly brown coat with darker markings around its eyes, ears, and legs. Its fur appears short and smooth, with a slightly glossy texture.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small in stature, with a compact and sturdy build. It has a broad head with a short muzzle, typical of the Griffon breed. The ears are large, triangular, and stand upright, adding to its alert appearance.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's most distinctive feature is its facial expression, characterized by wide, expressive eyes and a slightly open mouth with a visible pink tongue, giving it an endearing and playful look. The eyes are dark and almond-shaped, contributing to its alert and curious demeanor.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The dog's coat has a natural, untrimmed appearance, which is common for Griffons. There are no visible signs of grooming, suggesting it might be a working or show dog in its natural state. The overall body shape is muscular yet balanced, indicating good health and fitness.\n\nThis description should help",

The leash is thin and extends diagonally across the frame, attached to the collar worn by the dog. The collar itself is also dark brown and appears to have a simple, adjustable buckle. There are no visible patterns or additional embellishments on either the leash or the collar. The leash is relatively short compared to the dog's body, suggesting it might be used for close proximity walks rather than long-distance strolls.
