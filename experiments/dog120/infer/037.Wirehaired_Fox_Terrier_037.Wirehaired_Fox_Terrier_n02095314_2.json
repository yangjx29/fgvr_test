The fur appears slightly darker around the muzzle and nose area.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur is short, wiry, and dense, giving it a distinctive look typical of terriers. The texture is rough and slightly uneven, which is characteristic of wire-haired breeds. There are no distinct patterns, as the fur is uniformly short and dense across the face.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The face is small and compact, with a rounded head and a short snout. The eyes are dark and expressive, with a slightly alert expression. The ears are small and pointed, standing upright.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's eyes are particularly striking due to their dark color and the way they reflect light, giving them a glossy appearance.
