The fur is fluffy and curly, characteristic of the breed.\n\n- **Texture**: The coat is thick and soft, with a curly texture that is typical for Bichons. The fur around the face is particularly dense and frizzy.\n\n- **Eyes**: The eyes are dark and expressive, with a slightly almond shape. They appear bright and alert, which is common in Bichons.\n\n- **Ears**: The ears are large, floppy, and rounded at the tips. They hang down close to the sides of the head, framing the face nicely.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's head is small and round, with a short muzzle. The overall body is compact and well-proportioned, fitting within the typical Bichon Frise size range.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Bichon Frise often has a \"fringe\" of hair around the mouth and chin, giving it a distinctive look.
