This texture is consistent with the dog's thick, curly coat.\n- **Shape and Size**: The beard and mustache extend downward from the mouth area, forming a noticeable chin-like extension. They are relatively large in proportion to the face, adding to the dog's unique look.\n- **Unique Features**: The beard and mustache are well-defined and contribute significantly to the dog's overall facial expression, giving it a somewhat serious or contemplative appearance.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The beard and mustache are symmetrical and evenly distributed on either side of the mouth, enhancing the dog's balanced and well-groomed appearance.\n\nThese features make the beard and mustache stand out as distinctive characteristics of this breed, helping to distinguish it from other similar breeds.",

The texture of the fur is dense and wavy, giving it a shaggy appearance.

The ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to the overall fluffy look. The tail is also thick and curls upwards, contributing to the dog's robust appearance.\n\nUnique or distinctive features include the dog's facial expression, which appears calm and alert, and the overall bushy coat that covers the body evenly. There are no visible markings or patterns other than the natural variation in color and texture.\n\nThis combination of characteristics—thick, curly black fur, sturdy build, and distinctive facial features—helps distinguish this dog as a Black Russian Terrier, a breed known for its distinctive appearance and protective nature.",
