The white markings are concentrated around the muzzle, chest, and paws, creating a striking contrast against the darker fur.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur appears soft and slightly wavy, giving it a fluffy appearance. The texture is consistent across the body, though the white areas may feel slightly smoother due to less dense fur.\n\n- **Patterns**: The white markings form a symmetrical pattern around the face, extending down the chest and onto the paws. The eyes are surrounded by dark fur, which frames them and adds depth to the expression.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's face is rounded, with large, expressive eyes that are a light brown color. The nose is a lighter shade of brown, almost pinkish, and is centrally located between the eyes. The ears are long and floppy, hanging down on either side of the head, adding to the symmetrical look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes are particularly noticeable for their size and the way they reflect light, giving them a bright, alert appearance.
