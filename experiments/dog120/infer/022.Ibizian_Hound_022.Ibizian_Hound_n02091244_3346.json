They are proportionate to the head and body, neither too large nor too small.\n- **Unique Features**: The ears have a distinct triangular shape with a pointed tip, which is characteristic of certain breeds like the Ibizan Hound. This shape is both symmetrical and well-defined.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: There are no visible signs of any unique markings or patterns within the ear itself; it maintains a uniform color throughout.\n\nThese features collectively help identify the ears as belonging to a specific breed, likely the Ibizan Hound, known for their distinctive ear shape and coloration.",

The white fur covers most of the body, including the legs, chest, and face, while the brown fur is concentrated on the back, tail, and part of the legs. The brown patches appear as irregular spots and streaks, creating a mottled effect.\n\nThe texture of the fur appears smooth and short, typical of many breeds. There are no visible signs of shedding or mats, suggesting the dog is well-groomed. The dog's ears are pointed and stand upright, adding to its alert appearance.\n\nThe dog's posture is upright and attentive, with its front legs straight and back legs slightly bent, indicating it is standing firmly on the wet sand. The overall shape of the dog is slender and athletic, which could suggest it is a breed known for agility and speed.\n\nUnique features include the contrast between the white and brown fur, which makes the dog visually striking against the natural background. The dog's ears and the shape of its head also contribute to its distinctive look. There are no visible variations or special characteristics that set it apart from other dogs, as it seems to be a standard example of its breed.",

The reddish-brown patches are irregularly shaped and cover parts of the dog's back, legs, and tail.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The dog is medium-sized with a lean yet muscular build. Its body is elongated, and it stands tall on its hind legs, giving it an alert posture. The head is proportionally small compared to the body, with pointed ears that stand erect.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's most noticeable feature is its coloration, which is a mix of white and reddish-brown.
