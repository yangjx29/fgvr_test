Its head is proportionally large compared to its body, with pointed ears that stand upright.\n\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - The dog has a heart-shaped tag around its neck, which adds a personal touch.\n  - Its eyes are a striking blue, which stands out against the light brown fur.\n  - The dog's expression seems curious or attentive, with its ears perked up and its gaze directed towards the camera.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's fur looks well-groomed, and there are no visible signs of shedding or mats. The overall impression is one of a healthy and well-cared-for pet.\n\nThese features collectively make the dog easily identifiable as a small, light brown terrier with",

The tag is heart-shaped with a red background and white text, which contrasts sharply against the metallic collar. The heart shape is small and delicate, fitting snugly around the dog's neck. The text on the tag is not clearly legible due to the angle and lighting, but it appears to be printed in a standard font. The collar itself seems to be a thin band, possibly adjustable, as it fits closely around the dog's neck without being overly tight. The overall appearance suggests a simple yet functional design, typical for pet collars.",

The background includes a person's leg wearing dark pants and a black shoe, suggesting a casual home setting. There is also a patterned rug under the dog, featuring a mix of beige and gray tones with a subtle geometric design.
