The fur appears fluffy and slightly wavy, giving it a soft and textured appearance. The ears are floppy and hang down close to the head, adding to the overall fluffy look. The eyes are dark and expressive, and the nose is black, which contrasts nicely with the lighter fur. The dog's face is relatively small compared to its body, and the ears are large and rounded at the tips. The dog's expression seems happy and relaxed, with its tongue slightly out, suggesting it might be enjoying the beach environment.",
            "The dog in the image appears to be a Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier (SCWT), also known as a \"Wheaten.\" Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a light golden or wheaten-colored coat that is soft and slightly wavy. This coloration is consistent across its body, with no distinct markings or patterns other than natural variations in shade.\n\n- **Texture**: The coat is thick and dense, giving it a fluffy appearance. It looks soft to the touch and has a natural sheen, which is typical of the breed.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a medium-sized build with a sturdy yet elegant frame. Its body is proportionate, with a slightly longer back and a compact, muscular build. The head is medium-sized with a broad forehead and a strong muzzle. The ears are floppy and hang close to the head.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature of the SCWT is its coat, which is one of the breed's defining characteristics. The coat is not only soft and wavy but also has a natural sheen that gives it a healthy, well-groomed look. The dog's expression is friendly and alert, with a slightly open mouth showing its tongue,",

There are no visible markings or tags on the visible part of the dog's body that could definitively indicate a specific breed.\n\n- **Color**: The primary color is white, which covers most of the visible parts of the dog.\n- **Texture**: The fur looks soft and slightly wavy, suggesting a thick coat.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact body with a relatively short snout and a sturdy build. The tail is not fully visible, but it seems to be of moderate length and thickness, consistent with the overall body shape.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog has a black nose and dark eyes, which contrast nicely with the white fur. The ears are floppy and appear to have some darker fur around them, possibly indicating a different coloration in that area.\n\nWithout more specific information or visible breed markers, it's challenging to pinpoint an exact breed. However, the overall appearance suggests a breed like a Soft Coated Wheaten Terrier, a West Highland White Terrier, or a similar small to medium-sized terrier type."
