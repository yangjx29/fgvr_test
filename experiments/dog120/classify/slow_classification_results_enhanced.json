The similarity scores provided by the search engine also indicate a high likelihood of the dog being a Golden Retriever, with the highest score being 0.3383 for Silky Terrier, which is significantly lower than the scores for other breeds. The dog's friendly expression and the specific combination of ear shape, fur texture, and facial structure align closely with those of a Golden Retriever. | Key Features: Light golden coat, floppy ears, broad and rounded muzzle, and a friendly expression. | Uncertainty: While the similarity scores suggest a high probability of the dog being a Golden Retriever, there could be slight variations in the breed's appearance due to individual differences. However, the visual evidence strongly supports this classification.",
