The color is uniform across the visible parts, giving it a clean and pristine appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals appear smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light softly, which enhances their delicate nature. There are no visible textures like spots, lines, or ridges; the surface is uniformly smooth.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and oval-shaped, with a gentle curve towards the edges.

The overall shape is balanced and harmonious, typical of many orchid species.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The central part of the flower, where the stamen and pistil are located, has a lighter, almost creamy yellow hue compared to the rest of the petals.
