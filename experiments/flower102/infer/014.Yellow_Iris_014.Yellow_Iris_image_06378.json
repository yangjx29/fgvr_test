The spots are elongated and somewhat linear, resembling small, dark specks scattered across the petal's surface.\n\nThe upper petals are smaller and more upright, with a similar smooth texture and coloration. They also feature the same dark brown spotting pattern, though less densely packed than on the larger lower petal. The overall shape of the petals is oval to slightly teardrop-shaped, with a gentle curve at the tips.\n\nThe distinctive features of this iris include the contrasting colors, the spotted pattern, and the ruffled edges of the petals.
