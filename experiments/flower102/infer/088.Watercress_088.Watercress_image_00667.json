            "The center of the nasturtium flower in the image is composed of numerous stamens, which are light yellow in color with a slightly textured surface. These stamens are densely packed together, creating a central column that contrasts with the vibrant yellow petals surrounding it. The stamens have a delicate, feathery appearance due to their fine filaments, which are topped with reddish-brown anthers. This arrangement is characteristic of nasturtiums, as the stamens are typically more prominent and visually distinct compared to other flowers like daisies or sunflowers. The stamens are relatively small in comparison to the overall size of the flower, but they are crucial for pollination and stand out due to their contrasting color and texture against the petals.",

They are a vibrant green with prominent white veins radiating from the central vein, creating a net-like pattern. The leaves are relatively large compared to the flowers, with a size that can vary depending on the age and health of the plant. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable along the veins. There are no distinct color variations within the leaves; they maintain a consistent green hue throughout. The leaves' shape is ovate, meaning they are broadly oval with a pointed tip, which helps distinguish them from other similar categories such as those of the daisy family, which typically have more rounded or lobed leaves."
