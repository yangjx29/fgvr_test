The texture and arrangement of the petals, along with the drooping labellum, align closely with the visual characteristics of the Moon Orchid.

The petal shapes are broad and rounded, with the largest petal forming the backdrop of the flower, while the smaller petals curve inward, creating a layered effect. The center of the flower displays a distinctive red pattern, which contrasts sharply with the white petals, adding a unique focal point.

The texture seems fine and uniform across the surface.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are no prominent patterns on the petals themselves; however, the center of the flower (the labellum) has a distinctive red marking with intricate lines and dots, creating a striking contrast against the white background. This pattern is unique to the species and serves as a key identifying feature.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and rounded, with the largest petal being the dorsal one, which is positioned at the back. The lateral petals are slightly smaller and curve upwards.
