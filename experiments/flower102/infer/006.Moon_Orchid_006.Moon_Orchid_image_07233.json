The edges of the petals have a delicate, slightly ruffled texture, adding a soft, natural appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The surface of the petals appears smooth with a slight sheen, indicative of a healthy plant. The edges are not sharply defined but rather have a gentle curve, contributing to the overall elegance of the flower.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are large and broad, with a rounded shape. The central petal (lip) is particularly prominent and curves downward, forming a key part of the orchid's structure. The other petals are slightly smaller and more upright, creating a balanced and harmonious form.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The lip of the orchid has a unique pattern with a gradient from white to pink, which is characteristic of certain orchid species.

This coloration is soft and gentle, creating a harmonious and elegant appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals appear smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light softly, which enhances their delicate beauty. The texture seems fine and not overly rough, contributing to the overall refined look of the flower.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and rounded, with the upper two petals (dorsal and lateral sepals) being larger and more upright, while the lower petal (lip) is broader and more spread out. The lip has a distinct, heart-like shape with a central column (columna) that is greenish-yellow with some purple streaks, adding contrast to the white background.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most striking feature is the lip, which is deeply lobed and has a prominent keel (the central part of the lip) that curves upwards.
