The texture appears smooth and delicate, contrasting with the vibrant pink petals surrounding it. The shape of the center is circular, with a slightly raised, dome-like structure that houses the stamen and pistil. This central area is smaller in size compared to the expansive petal area, making it a focal point of the flower's design.\n\nThe white center has subtle variations in shading, with some areas appearing slightly brighter than others, which adds depth and dimension to the overall look. There are no distinct patterns within the center itself; instead, the variation in color and light creates a natural, organic feel. The stamen and pistil are not clearly visible, suggesting they may be very fine or hidden within the white center, contributing to the flower's elegant simplicity.",

The petals are smooth and have a slightly ruffled texture, giving them a delicate appearance. The edges of the petals are slightly wavy and show a subtle gradient from a deeper pink at the tips to a lighter shade near the center. The symmetry of the petals is evident, with each petal curving outward from the center, creating a circular shape. The white center is prominent and contrasts sharply with the pink petals, making it a distinctive feature. The overall size of the flower appears to be medium, typical of morning glories. There are no visible spots or blemishes, and the flower's structure is intact, showcasing its natural beauty.",

The center of the flower is white, with a small, round, and slightly raised area that appears to be the stigma.

The texture is delicate and contrasts sharply with the vibrant pink petals.\n   - The white center has subtle variations in shading, adding depth and dimension. The stamen and pistil are not distinctly visible, suggesting they might be very fine or hidden within the white center, contributing to the flower’s elegant simplicity.\n\n2. **Petal Edges and Symmetry:**\n   - The petals are smooth and have a slightly ruffled texture, giving them a delicate appearance.\n   - The edges of the petals are wavy and show a gradient from deep pink",
