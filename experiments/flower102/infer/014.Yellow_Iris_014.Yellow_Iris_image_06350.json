            "The dried parts at the base of the yellow iris flower exhibit distinct characteristics that set them apart from the vibrant petals:\n\n- **Color**: The dried parts are a muted brownish-gray, contrasting sharply with the bright yellow of the petals. This coloration is indicative of decay and desiccation.\n\n- **Texture**: The dried parts have a rough, fibrous texture, which is different from the smooth, slightly glossy surface of the healthy petals. The fibers appear brittle and somewhat disorganized, suggesting they have lost their moisture and flexibility.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: These dried parts are smaller and more compact compared to the large, open petals. They are clustered together at the base of the flower, forming a dense, irregular mass. The shape is irregular and somewhat shriveled, lacking the symmetry and smoothness of the petals.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dried parts have a mottled appearance with subtle variations in shade, adding to their distinctive look. There are no visible patterns, but the texture itself is quite varied, with some areas appearing more tightly packed than others.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The dried parts show signs of natural aging and decomposition. The edges of these parts are often frayed or curled, further emphasizing their state of decay. This",

The center of the flower displays darker yellow streaks, adding depth and contrast.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals have a smooth, slightly glossy texture, which is typical for irises, enhancing their luminosity. The center of the flower appears more textured, with fine, intricate details that stand out against the smoother petals.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and flat, with a slightly ruffled edge, giving them a delicate yet robust appearance. The flower is medium-sized, neither too small nor overly large, making it visually appealing within the frame.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The prominent upright petal (the \"stand-up\" petal) is a characteristic feature of many iris species, providing a striking focal point.
