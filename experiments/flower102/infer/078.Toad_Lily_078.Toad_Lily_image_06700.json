The center of the flower is a vibrant yellow, contrasting sharply with the purple petals. The texture appears smooth yet slightly velvety, enhancing the visual appeal.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and flat, with a slightly ruffled edge, contributing to a soft, almost ethereal look.

The overall size of the flower is relatively small compared to some other large-flowered species, making it appear compact and elegant.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the combination of the spotted petals and the contrasting colors of the center. The maroon base of the stamens adds another layer of visual interest, making the flower stand out. Additionally, the petal",
