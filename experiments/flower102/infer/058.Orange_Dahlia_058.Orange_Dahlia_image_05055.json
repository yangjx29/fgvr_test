Each stamen has a slender, elongated shape with a slightly curved tip, contributing to the overall intricate structure of the flower's center. The color of the stamens is a bright, uniform yellow, which contrasts sharply with the orange petals surrounding them. This vivid yellow hue is consistent across all the stamens, enhancing their visibility and making them a focal point within the flower. The texture of the stamens appears slightly fuzzy or velvety, adding to the tactile complexity of the flower's center. There are no visible patterns or variations in the stamens' appearance; they maintain a uniform shape and color throughout, which helps to distinguish this flower's center from others that might have more varied or patterned structures.",

The center of each petal is densely packed with fine, yellow filaments that form a bright, textured core. The petals are broad and slightly overlapping, creating a layered effect around the flower's center. The overall shape is rounded and slightly pointed at the tips, contributing to the flower's full and lush appearance. The petal edges are not sharply defined but have a subtle, wavy pattern that adds to the texture. This combination of color, texture, and shape distinguishes these petals from those of other species, making them visually striking and unique within their category.",
