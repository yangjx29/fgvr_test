The arrangement of the petals is somewhat asymmetrical, with some petals overlapping others, which adds to the natural and organic look of the bloom.\n\nThe center of the flower features a prominent, darker orange petal that contrasts with the lighter outer petals. This central petal has a more solid coloration compared to the surrounding ones, which have a more intricate pattern due to the interplay of the colors. The petals are attached to a thick, green stem, which supports the substantial size of the flower.\n\nUnique to this type of flower, the Canna indica typically has a robust structure, with leaves that can grow quite large and sword-like.

The texture appears slightly rough and fibrous, giving it a somewhat leathery look.\n\n2. **Texture and Patterns**: The petals have a slightly wrinkled texture, which is typical for canna flowers. There are no distinct patterns on the petals; instead, the coloration and slight variations in shade create a natural, organic appearance.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and flat, with a ruffled edge that adds to their distinctive shape. They are large compared to the stamens and pistils, which are smaller and less prominent.\n\n4. **Unique Features**:\n   - **Stamens**: These are not prominently visible in the image due to the angle and focus on the petals.
