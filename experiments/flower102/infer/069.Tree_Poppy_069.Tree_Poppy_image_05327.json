The center is vibrant yellow with densely packed stamens forming a circular pattern. | Uncertainty: While the similarity scores suggest a high confidence in the classification as a Tree Poppy, it is important to note that other flowers like Oxeye Daisy and Marigold share some visual similarities.

            "The flower in the image has large, white petals with a slightly ruffled texture along the edges, giving them a delicate and soft appearance. The petals are broad and layered, creating a full and lush look. The center of the flower is a vibrant yellow, composed of numerous small, densely packed stamens that form a circular pattern around a central point. This yellow core contrasts sharply with the white petals, making it a focal point of the flower.\n\nThe petals have a smooth surface with subtle variations in color intensity, which adds depth and dimension to the flower's overall appearance. There are no distinct patterns on the petals; they are uniformly white with a slight gradient towards the tips, which may appear slightly lighter due to the angle of light.\n\nThe flower's size is substantial, taking up a significant portion of the frame, indicating it is likely a mature specimen. Its shape is rounded and symmetrical, typical of many flowering plants. The green foliage surrounding the flower provides a natural backdrop that enhances the contrast between the white petals and the yellow center.\n\nThis flower stands out due to its striking color combination and the contrast between the soft, ruffled edges of the petals and the bright, dense center. These features make it visually distinct from other flowers that might share similar petal shapes",
            "The flower in the image displays a striking transition between white and yellow in its petals. The outer petals are predominantly white, with a smooth, slightly ruffled texture that gives them a delicate appearance. As you move towards the center, the petals gradually shift to a vibrant yellow, creating a seamless gradient effect. This color transition is not abrupt but rather a soft blend, enhancing the flower's overall beauty.\n\nThe yellow center is densely packed with numerous small, tightly clustered petals, forming a bright, eye-catching core. These central petals have a more textured appearance compared to the outer ones, with visible veins and a slightly rougher surface. The contrast between the smooth white petals and the textured yellow center adds depth and visual interest to the flower.\n\nThe shape of the petals is broad and slightly curved, contributing to the fullness of the bloom. The size of the petals is consistent throughout, maintaining a uniform appearance across the flower. The overall structure of the flower is symmetrical, with the white and yellow gradients creating a harmonious balance.\n\nUnique to this flower is the clear distinction between the white and yellow sections, which is not common in many other flower species. This characteristic, combined with the smooth-to-textured gradient and the symmetrical shape, sets it apart from similar categories of flowers",
            "The center of the flower in the image is a vibrant yellow, composed of numerous densely packed stamens. The stamens have a textured appearance with fine, thread-like filaments that converge towards a central pistil. The pistil itself appears as a small, light-colored structure at the very heart of the flower, surrounded by the yellow stamens. The stamens are arranged in a circular pattern around the pistil, creating a striking contrast against the white petals surrounding it. This central feature is distinct due to its bright color and intricate structure, which sets it apart from the smooth, petal-like edges of the surrounding white petals. The overall shape of the center is compact and rounded, making it visually prominent within the flower's composition."
