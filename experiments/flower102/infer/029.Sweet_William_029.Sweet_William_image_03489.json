Some petals have a soft white base that transitions into a vibrant pink towards the tips, creating a delicate and layered appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals appear soft and slightly ruffled, giving them a delicate and almost velvety texture. This is evident in how they curve and overlap each other.\n\n- **Patterns**: Each flower has a distinct pattern with a darker pink or purple center surrounded by lighter pink petals. The center often has a star-like or circular pattern with darker veins radiating outward, adding depth and contrast to the flower's overall look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The flowers are relatively small, with each bloom typically having five petals arranged in a circular pattern. They are densely packed together, forming a lush and full cluster.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the soft pink tones, the subtle gradient effect, and the intricate patterns in the centers make these flowers visually striking.
