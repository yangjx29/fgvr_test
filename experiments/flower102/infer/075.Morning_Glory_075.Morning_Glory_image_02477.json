The size of the petals is substantial, making the flower appear quite large compared to the surrounding greenery.

As the petals radiate outward from the center, they transition into a deep purple hue, creating a beautiful ombre effect. The center of the flower is a rich, dark purple, almost black, which contrasts sharply with the surrounding white petals.\n\nThe shape of the flower is circular, with the petals arranged in a symmetrical pattern, converging towards the center. The size of the flower is relatively large compared to the surrounding greenery, making it stand out prominently against the grassy background. The flower's unique feature is the smooth gradient of colors, which is not typical for many flowers, making it visually distinct from other similar categories such as daisies or roses. The texture of the petals, while generally smooth, has subtle variations that add to its natural beauty.",

The texture appears to be fine and granular, giving it a velvety look. The center is circular and occupies a smaller area compared to the surrounding petals. It has a distinct, darker purple ring around the central core, which is slightly lighter in color than the outermost part of the center. This ring adds a subtle gradient effect, enhancing the visual contrast against the white petals. The overall shape is compact and rounded, making it a focal point within the flower's structure. There are no visible stamens extending outward; instead, the center seems to be a dense cluster of pollen-producing structures."
