They are numerous, densely packed, and extend outward from the center.\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of bright yellow with dark stripes is unique to this species and helps in distinguishing it from other similar flowers.

The stripe is more pronounced at the base and gradually narrows as it approaches the petal's edge. The surrounding area of the petal is a lighter shade of yellow or cream, creating a contrast with the darker stripe.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and flat, with a slightly ruffled appearance along the edges.
