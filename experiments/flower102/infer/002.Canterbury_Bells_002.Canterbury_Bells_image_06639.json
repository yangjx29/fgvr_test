The stamen and pistil are a contrasting greenish-yellow.\n\n2. **Texture and Patterns**: The petals have a smooth texture with subtle veins visible near the center. The stamen and pistil appear to be covered with fine hairs, giving them a slightly fuzzy appearance.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**:\n   - **Petals**: The petals are bell-shaped, drooping slightly downward, and are the largest part of the flower.

There are no distinct patterns on the leaves; they are uniformly green without any variegation or coloration.
