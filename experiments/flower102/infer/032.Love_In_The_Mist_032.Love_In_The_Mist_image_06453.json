The central column, which supports the anthers, appears slightly thicker than the individual filaments and is also green, blending seamlessly into the overall structure.\n\nThe stamens are arranged symmetrically around the central column, creating a starburst pattern. This arrangement is characteristic of many flower species and helps in pollination by ensuring efficient distribution of pollen. The green coloration of the stamens and central column is consistent throughout, with no visible variations or special characteristics that stand out distinctly from other stamens in the same category. The texture is uniformly fine and smooth, contributing to the delicate appearance of the flower's reproductive parts.",

The petals are large and spread out, forming a star-like pattern around the center. Each petal has a subtle gradient, transitioning from a deeper blue at the base to a lighter shade towards the tips. The edges of the petals are not sharply defined; instead, they have a soft, almost wavy texture, adding to their unique charm. The overall shape is symmetrical, contributing to the flower's elegant look. There are no distinct patterns on the petals, making their uniform color and texture stand out as key visual characteristics.
