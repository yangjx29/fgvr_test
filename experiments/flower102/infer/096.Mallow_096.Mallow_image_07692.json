The center of the flower is densely packed with stamens, creating a textured focal point.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The flower is relatively large compared to the surrounding leaves, which are also visible in the image. It has a broad, open shape with five distinct petals that spread outwards, forming a star-like pattern.

These leaves are broad and lobed, with a serrated edge, which helps in distinguishing them from other plant species. The leaves vary in size, with some being larger and more mature, while others appear smaller and possibly younger, attached to the same stem as the flower.
