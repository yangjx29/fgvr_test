The similarity scores also indicate that 'Sunflower' has the highest score among the candidates, further supporting this classification. | Key Features: The central disk composed of small, dark brownish-orange seeds and the surrounding bright yellow petals arranged in a radial pattern are key features that identify this flower as a sunflower. | Uncertainty: There are no significant uncertainty factors affecting this classification.

The petals have a slightly textured appearance, with visible veins and a smooth, glossy surface. The overall shape of the flower is symmetrical and large, with the central seed head being significantly smaller than the expansive petal arrangement. The sunflower's bright yellow color and the intricate details of the seed head make it distinct from other flowers, particularly those with simpler centers or different petal colors.",
            "The bee in the image has a dark, almost black body with a shiny, smooth texture. Its wings appear translucent with visible veins, and it has a robust build, which contrasts with the delicate petals of the sunflower. The bee's head is slightly larger than its thorax, and it has two prominent antennae. The bee's legs are not clearly visible, but they seem to be adapted for gripping the sunflower's center. The bee's presence on the sunflower is a non-standard feature, as bees typically collect nectar from flowers like sunflowers, not the sunflower itself. This bee appears to be interacting with the sunflower's center, possibly feeding or pollinating.",
            "The flower in the image is a sunflower, characterized by its large, round head with a dense cluster of small, dark brownish-orange seeds at the center. Surrounding this central disk are numerous long, slender petals arranged in a radial pattern, radiating outward from the center. The petals are bright yellow with a slightly textured surface, giving them a slightly rough appearance. The overall shape is circular, with the petals extending symmetrically around the central disk.\n\nThe sunflower's size is quite large compared to the bee perched on it, emphasizing the flower's prominence. The bee, while smaller, provides a sense of scale and highlights the flower's substantial size. The sunflower's distinctive features include the contrast between the dark center and the vibrant yellow petals, as well as the uniformity of the petal arrangement. These characteristics make it easily identifiable as a sunflower, distinguishing it from other flowers with similar petal structures but different coloration or arrangements."
