Each petal is distinct yet harmoniously connected, forming a symmetrical arrangement around the central structure.\n\nThe unique features include the gradient coloration, which is not uniform across the petals but rather fades smoothly from red to yellow. This gradient is a distinctive characteristic that sets it apart from other flowers. Additionally, the presence of green stamens extending outward adds a contrasting element to the predominantly red and yellow hues.

They are arranged in a circular pattern around the pistil, which is located at the very center of the flower.\n- **Pistil**: The pistil is short and green, positioned at the heart of the flower, surrounded by the stamens.\n\n### Visual Characteristics:\n- **Color**: The petals display a striking gradient from deep red at the base to a lighter yellow towards the tips. The stamens are a vivid greenish-yellow, contrasting sharply with the petals.\n- **Texture**: The petals have a smooth texture, while the stamens appear slightly more delicate and less textured.\n- **Patterns**: The petals exhibit a natural, organic shape with slight variations in width and curvature, adding to their beauty. The stamens are uniform in shape but vary in length.\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are large",
