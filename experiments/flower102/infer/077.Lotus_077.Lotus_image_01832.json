The center of the flower is slightly lighter, almost white, which contrasts beautifully with the outer petals.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The petals have a smooth texture with subtle veins running through them, adding depth and detail. There are no distinct patterns on the petals; they appear uniformly smooth, enhancing the flower's elegant simplicity.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: Each petal is broad and slightly pointed at the tips, contributing to the overall symmetrical and balanced look of the flower. The petals are arranged in a circular pattern around the central bud, creating a full and lush appearance. The size of the petals varies slightly, with some being larger and more prominent than others, which adds dimension to the flower.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The lotus flower is characterized by its large, rounded petals that are slightly overlapping each other.
