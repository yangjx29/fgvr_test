Here's a detailed description focusing on the petal edges and textures:\n\n- **Color**: The petals are predominantly white with subtle hints of light lavender or pale blue, especially noticeable near the center where the petals meet. The inner part of the flower, particularly around the lip, has a yellowish hue with a slight gradient towards the edges.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals exhibit a smooth texture with a slight sheen, possibly due to moisture or the natural wax coating found on many orchids. The edges of the petals are slightly ruffled or fringed, adding a soft, almost ethereal quality to the flower.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and flat, with the largest petal being the dorsal (upper) petal, which is elongated and slightly curved. The lateral petals are shorter and broader, with a more rounded shape. The lip, which is the lowermost petal, is distinctively larger and more complex, with a prominent keel and a fringed edge.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The lip is particularly notable for its intricate details, including the keel (a central ridge) and the fringed edges, which are characteristic",
