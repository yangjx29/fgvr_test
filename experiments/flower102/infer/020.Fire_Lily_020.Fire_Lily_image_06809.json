The stamens themselves are not prominently visible in this image, but their presence is implied by the structure of the flower. The green central part serves as a stark contrast to the bright orange and yellow tepals, which have a smooth, glossy texture and exhibit a gradient of color from yellow at the base to a deeper orange at the tips. The overall appearance of the central part is simple yet distinct, making it a key feature for identifying this flower species.",

The texture appears smooth with subtle veins visible, adding depth to the petals' surface. The edges of the petals are distinctly wavy and slightly curled, giving them a dynamic and almost flame-like appearance. This curvature is a key feature that sets it apart from more uniform petal shapes.\n\nThe size of each petal varies, with some being larger and more prominent than others, creating an asymmetrical yet balanced overall shape. The central part of the flower, where the stamens are located, is green and contrasts sharply with the vivid colors of the petals. The stamens themselves are slender and pale green, extending outward from the center, adding to the flower's intricate detail.\n\nThis combination of color, texture, and unique petal curvature makes the flower visually striking and easily distinguishable from other similar species.",

The edges of the petals have a slightly ruffled texture, adding to their dynamic appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals exhibit a smooth surface with subtle ridges along the edges, enhancing the flame-like effect. The center of the flower has a green, spiky structure, which contrasts sharply with the colorful petals.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are elongated and pointed, with a slight curve towards the tips. They are large and spread out, creating a dramatic and eye-catching display. The central part of the flower, including the stamens, is smaller and more delicate compared to the boldness of the petals.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the petal arrangement, which resembles flames, hence the name \"Fire Lily.\" This unique shape and coloration set it apart from other lilies, such as the Tiger Lily, which typically has more rounded petals and a different color pattern.\n\n- **Variations"
