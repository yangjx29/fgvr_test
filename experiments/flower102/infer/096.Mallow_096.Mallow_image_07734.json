The center of the flower has a rich, dark red hue, which contrasts sharply with the lighter outer petals.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals have a slightly velvety texture, evident from the fine, raised lines that run along their length. These lines create a subtle, intricate pattern that adds depth to the flower's appearance.\n\n- **Patterns**: The veins on the petals are prominent and clearly visible, adding to the intricate design. The veins are a darker shade of red, which enhances the contrast against the lighter background of the petals.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and slightly cup-shaped, with a rounded tip. They are relatively large compared to the overall size of the flower, giving it a full and lush appearance. The flower itself is attached to a green stem, which supports the structure.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the gradient coloration, the velvety texture, and the prominent vein patterns makes this flowering maple distinct.

Here's a detailed description focusing on its symmetry, structure, and visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The flower displays a gradient of colors, transitioning from a vibrant orange at the base to a deeper red towards the center. The petals have a subtle, almost translucent quality with visible veins that are highlighted by the red coloration, creating a striking pattern.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The surface of the petals appears smooth but slightly textured due to the fine veins running through them. These veins are more pronounced near the center of the flower, adding depth and complexity to the petal structure.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The flower has a bell-shaped or campanulate form, which is characteristic of Abutilon species. It is relatively small compared to some other flowers, with a diameter that appears to be around 3-4 cm. The petals are slightly ruffled at the edges, giving it a delicate and airy appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature of this Abutilon is its color gradient and the intricate vein patterns on the petals. The way the petals curve inward and the subtle translucency add to its unique beauty. Additionally, the presence",

The center of the flower has a darker, almost maroon hue.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The petals have a slightly velvety texture and are marked by intricate red veins that create a striking contrast against the lighter background color. The veins are more pronounced towards the edges of the petals, giving them a delicate, almost lace-like appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The flower is bell-shaped, with five broad, overlapping petals that curve slightly outward. The overall size appears to be medium, neither too large nor too small for a garden plant.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature of this Abutilon is the combination of the vibrant colors and the intricate vein patterns. The red veins are not only visually appealing but also serve a functional purpose in attracting pollinators. Additionally, the flower's shape and the way it hangs downward give it a unique and elegant appearance.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: Abutilons are known for their ability to bloom throughout the year in warm climates"
