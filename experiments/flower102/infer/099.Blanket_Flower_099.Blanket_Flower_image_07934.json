The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable where water droplets are present, suggesting recent rainfall or dew.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and flat, radiating outward from the central disc. They are uniform in shape, with a slightly pointed tip, contributing to the flower's symmetrical appearance. The size of each petal is consistent, maintaining the flower's balanced look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The central disc is composed of numerous small, dark reddish-brown bracts that form a dense, textured core. This contrasts sharply with the colorful petals, making it a distinctive feature of Blanket Flowers.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The petals' color gradient and the presence of water droplets add depth and vibrancy to the flower.
