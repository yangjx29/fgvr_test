The broad, rounded petals with a soft, almost heart-like shape, the smooth velvety texture, and the subtle yellowish-green hues near the center are all indicative of this species.

            "The central part of the flower where the petals meet is a prominent feature, showcasing a unique structure that distinguishes this orchid from others. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The central part displays a gradient of light yellow to white, with subtle hints of greenish-yellow near the edges. This coloration contrasts softly against the pure white of the surrounding petals.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The texture appears smooth and slightly velvety, with fine, delicate lines radiating outward from the center, creating a subtle pattern that enhances the intricate beauty of the flower. These lines are more pronounced towards the edges of the central area.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The central part is circular and slightly raised, forming a dome-like shape. It is approximately the same width as the petals at their widest point, making it a focal point of the flower. Its size is proportionate to the overall flower, ensuring it remains visually striking without overpowering the rest of the bloom.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the central column, which is composed of fused stamens and pistils. This column is pale yellow and has a smooth, elongated shape that tapers slightly towards the top. It stands out due to its contrasting color and smooth texture compared",
            "The image depicts a white orchid with distinct petal edges that reveal subtle details characteristic of its species. Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The petals are predominantly white, with a slight gradient towards a pale yellow near the center. The edges of the petals have a delicate, almost translucent quality.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals exhibit a smooth texture with fine, subtle veins running through them. This texture is consistent across the surface, contributing to the overall delicate appearance.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are no prominent patterns on the petals; however, the veins create a natural, organic pattern that adds depth to the flower's appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and rounded, with a slightly ruffled edge along the perimeter. The central part of the flower, where the petals meet, forms a cup-like structure. The overall size appears relatively large compared to other orchids, suggesting it might be a species known for its size.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the ruffled edge of the petals, which is not common in all orchid species. This ruffling gives the flower a more intricate and detailed look.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The color gradient from white to pale yellow",

The coloration is smooth and uniform, with no visible spots or markings.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals appear soft and velvety, with a slightly ruffled texture that gives them a delicate and almost ethereal quality. This texture is consistent across all petals, contributing to the flower's overall pristine appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and rounded, with a gentle curve that creates a soft, almost heart-like shape when viewed from above. The petals are large in relation to the flower's overall size, which is typical for many orchids. The central column (columna) is short and yellow, contrasting subtly with the white petals.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the symmetrical arrangement of the petals. The two upper petals are slightly larger and more rounded than the two lower petals, creating a balanced and harmonious look. The petals are arranged in a way that suggests a natural, organic form, yet the symmetry is precise, hinting at a specific genus or family.\n\n"
