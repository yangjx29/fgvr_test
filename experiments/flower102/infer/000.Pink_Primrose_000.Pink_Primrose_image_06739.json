The stamens have a bright yellow coloration, while the pistil appears as a slender, light green structure extending upwards.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The stamens have a fine, delicate texture, with numerous filaments radiating outward from the central column. The pistil has a smooth, elongated appearance, tapering towards the tip. The petals exhibit subtle veining, adding a delicate pattern to their surface.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The stamens are thin and numerous, forming a dense cluster around the pistil. The pistil itself is slender and elongated, with a slightly thicker base that tapers into a fine point. The overall size of the central structure is relatively small compared to the petals, which dominate the flower's appearance.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The bright yellow color of the stamens and pistil stands out prominently against the pale petals.

The size of the petals suggests they are adapted for attracting pollinators through their size and color contrast.\n\nThe unique features include the combination of the light green color with white veining, the ruffled edges, and the bright yellow center.
