In terms of shape, it is conical and relatively small compared to the overall size of the flower, which is approximately 2-3 cm in length. This central part has a distinct, elongated shape that tapers towards the tip, which is characteristic of many flower species. There are no visible patterns or unique markings on the stamen itself; it is a simple, solid color.
