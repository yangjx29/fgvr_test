This coloration is consistent across all visible petals.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals have a delicate, almost translucent quality, with fine, hair-like structures (trichomes) that give them a slightly fuzzy appearance. This texture is particularly noticeable around the edges of the petals.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are elongated and narrow, with a slightly pointed tip. They are arranged in a circular pattern around the central structure, creating a star-like appearance.
