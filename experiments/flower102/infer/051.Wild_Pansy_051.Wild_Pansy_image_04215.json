            "The flower in the image is a white Viola (commonly known as a pansy or viola). Here's a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The petals are predominantly white with a yellow center. The yellow area is more concentrated towards the bottom of the flower, creating a distinct contrast against the white background.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable around the edges where they curve inward. The texture seems delicate and fine, typical of many Viola species.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are dark purple or black markings near the base of each petal, forming a V-shape that extends towards the center of the flower. These markings are a key identifying feature of certain Viola varieties.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and rounded at the tips, with a slightly ruffled appearance along the edges. They are arranged in a typical five-petal pattern, with two upper petals, two lower petals, and one central petal that is slightly larger and more prominent.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the white petals with the contrasting yellow center and the dark markings near the base of the petals is quite distinctive.

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The petals are predominantly white with a smooth texture. The center of the flower displays a bright yellow patch, which contrasts sharply with the white background. The yellow area has a slightly textured appearance, possibly due to fine hairs or a different cellular structure.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The flower is relatively small, typical for wild violets, with a diameter of approximately 2-3 cm. The petals are broad and rounded at the edges, with a slightly pointed tip. The shape is somewhat heart-shaped when viewed from above.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The flower exhibits a clear example of radial symmetry, meaning it looks the same from all angles. The stamen and pistil are visible within the flower. The stamen is located near the center, with the anther (pollen-producing part) appearing as a small, yellow structure.
