The white areas appear as small, delicate structures, possibly anthers and stigma.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The texture of the central part is smooth and slightly granular, typical of stamens. The white areas have a fine, almost powdery appearance, while the surrounding light purple areas have subtle veining, adding depth and detail.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The central cluster is smaller in size compared to the five large, star-shaped petals that radiate outward. It is compact and rounded, forming a dense core at the flower's heart.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The central cluster is composed of multiple stamens and a pistil. The stamens are slender and white, with visible filaments and anthers. The pistil, if present, is likely a single structure extending upward from the center, though it may be partially obscured by the stamens.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The white coloration of the central part is a distinctive",

The size of each petal is consistent, contributing to the symmetrical and balanced look of the flower.
