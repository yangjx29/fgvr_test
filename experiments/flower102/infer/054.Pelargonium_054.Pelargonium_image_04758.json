The size of the petals appears consistent across the flower, indicating a balanced and well-proportioned bloom. The center of the flower is not fully visible, but it seems to have a lighter, possibly white or cream-colored core, which contrasts subtly with the purple petals.\n\nUnique to this flower is its overall simplicity and elegance.
