The size of the center is relatively small compared to the petals, which are large and radiate outward.

The center of the flower is a darker, almost blackish-purple hue, which contrasts sharply with the lighter purple of the petals.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals have a smooth texture with a slight sheen, giving them a glossy appearance. The center of the flower appears slightly more textured, with small, densely packed structures that resemble tiny yellow dots.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The flower has a symmetrical, radial shape typical of daisies. Each petal is long and slender, radiating outward from the central disc. The flower is medium-sized, neither too large nor too small, making it visually striking yet not overwhelming.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the striped pattern on the petals, which is characteristic of certain varieties of African daisies. The contrast between the dark center and the lighter petals adds depth and visual interest.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: This particular African daisy exhibits a classic form with no visible abnormalities or unique mutations.
