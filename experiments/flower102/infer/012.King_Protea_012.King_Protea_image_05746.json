The center of the flower displays a dense cluster of yellowish-white stamens, creating a textured, almost honeycomb-like appearance.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The petals have a slightly ruffled texture, giving them a soft, almost velvety feel. The central stamen cluster is densely packed, with fine, thread-like filaments radiating outward, creating a complex and intricate pattern.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are elongated and pointed, arranged in a circular pattern around the central stamen cluster. They are relatively large compared to the overall size of the flower, contributing to its dramatic and imposing appearance. The petals are slightly overlapping, enhancing the three-dimensional effect.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The King Protea is distinguished by its large, showy flowers that can reach up to 30 cm in diameter.
