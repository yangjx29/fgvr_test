The petals are smooth and slightly ruffled, and the yellow center is circular and granular, consistent with the Oxeye Daisy's appearance. The similarity score for Oxeye Daisy is the highest among the candidates, further supporting this classification. | Key Features: The broad, white petals, the bright yellow center with a granular texture, and the overall daisy-like appearance are key features supporting the classification as an Oxeye Daisy. | Uncertainty: While the similarity scores suggest a high confidence in the classification, there could be slight confusion with other daisy-like flowers like Black-eyed Susan, but the granular texture of the yellow center and the pure white petals are more indicative of the Oxeye Daisy.",

This texture is consistent throughout the core.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The yellow core is circular in shape and occupies a significant portion of the flower's center. It is roughly the same diameter as the width of the petals at their base, making it a substantial part of the flower's overall structure.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The core's bright yellow color and textured surface make it stand out prominently against the white petals. There are no visible patterns or markings within the core itself; it is a solid, unadorned yellow.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The core maintains a consistent appearance across the entire flower, suggesting uniformity in the plant's growth pattern. There are no noticeable variations in color, texture, or shape within the core itself.\n\nThese characteristics collectively distinguish the yellow core from the surrounding white petals and any other potential centers of",

The petals are smooth and slightly ruffled at the edges, giving them a delicate appearance. The yellow center is densely packed with tiny, vibrant yellow florets.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals appear soft and slightly translucent, while the center is textured due to the numerous small florets. The background vegetation has a rougher texture, with blades of grass and other plants that are out of focus.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The daisy is round and symmetrical, with the petals radiating outward from the central yellow core. It is relatively large compared to the surrounding vegetation, which appears smaller and more indistinct.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The daisy's distinct shape, the sharp contrast between the white petals and the yellow center, and the overall simplicity of its design make it easily recognizable. The petals' slight ruffling adds a natural, organic touch.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The daisy's uniformity in color and pattern makes it stand out from other flowers that might have more varied colors or textures.
