The shape is somewhat bell-shaped, with the petals curving inward towards the center, where a prominent pinkish-red stamen is visible. The size of the flower is relatively large compared to the surrounding green leaves, making it stand out prominently.

The center of the flower is a deep pinkish-red, adding another layer of color complexity.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The petals have a slightly velvety texture, giving them a soft and almost velvety feel. The red veins are not just lines but appear to be slightly raised, adding depth to the petal surface. The center of the flower is densely packed with small, fuzzy structures, contributing to its intricate texture.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The flower is bell-shaped, with five broad, overlapping petals that curve slightly inward at the edges. The size appears to be medium, neither too large nor too small, making it easily noticeable among other flowers.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the yellow petals with red veins and the deep pink center is quite distinctive.
