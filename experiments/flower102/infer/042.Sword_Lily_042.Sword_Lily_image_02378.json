The stamen is faintly visible as a pale green line within this light green area, further confirming the identification. The similarity score for Sword Lily is the highest among the candidates, indicating a strong match. | Key Features: The broad, slightly pointed petals, the curved edges, the light green central area with a thread-like texture, and the presence of the stamen are key features supporting the identification as Sword Lily. | Uncertainty: There is a slight uncertainty due to the similarity scores being close between Sword Lily and Hippeastrum.

This central part is slightly raised above the rest of the flower and has a fine, almost thread-like appearance. It is smaller in size compared to the surrounding petals, which are large and layered. The stamen itself is not prominently visible; instead, it appears as a faint, pale green line within the center, adding a touch of contrast against the light green background. The overall shape is compact and rounded, forming a small, intricate core at the heart of the flower. This central feature is unique to gladioli and helps distinguish them from other similar flowers like lilies or orchids.",
            "The edges of the petals where they curve and overlap in the image exhibit a delicate, soft white color with subtle hints of pale green at the base, indicating the presence of the flower's stem. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, which enhances the perception of freshness and elegance. The petals have a gentle, ruffled appearance, with each petal overlapping the next in a cascading manner, creating a layered effect.\n\nShape-wise, the petals are broad and slightly pointed at the tips, with a gentle curve that adds depth and dimension to the flower. The size of the petals is consistent throughout the arrangement, maintaining a harmonious balance within the bouquet. The unique feature here is the way the petals curve and overlap, forming a natural, flowing pattern that is both visually appealing and structurally sound.\n\nThere are no distinct patterns on the petals; their simplicity allows them to stand out individually while contributing to the overall beauty of the arrangement. The slight variations in the curvature and overlap of the petals add a dynamic quality to the image, distinguishing it from more uniform or rigid floral arrangements. This combination of softness, symmetry, and natural flow makes the flowers particularly striking and elegant.",
            "The green stems and buds surrounding the white gladiolus flowers exhibit a vibrant, fresh green color with a smooth, slightly glossy texture. These stems are slender and elongated, tapering towards the top where they transition into the flower buds. The buds themselves are cylindrical and pointed, with a smooth surface that appears firm and unopened.\n\nIn comparison to the flowers, the stems are taller and more numerous, providing structural support for the blooms. They vary in size, with some being thicker near the base and thinner as they extend upwards. The stems have a consistent green hue throughout their length, with no visible patterns or markings, which helps them stand out against the delicate white petals of the gladiolus flowers. The overall appearance is one of natural elegance and simplicity, characteristic of healthy, thriving plants."
