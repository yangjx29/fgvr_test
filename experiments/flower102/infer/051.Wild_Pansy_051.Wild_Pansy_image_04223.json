The lower two petals are predominantly yellow with a darker purple stripe running through them, creating a striking contrast.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The petals have a smooth texture with subtle veins visible, especially on the yellow petals. The purple stripes on the yellow petals add a unique pattern, enhancing the flower's visual appeal.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and rounded at the base, tapering slightly towards the tips.
