The petals are smooth with a slightly ruffled texture near the edges, giving them a delicate appearance. The center of the flower is densely packed with small, pinkish-orange florets, creating a textured, almost fuzzy look.\n\nIn terms of shape, the flower is circular, with the petals arranged in a radial pattern, which enhances its symmetrical appearance. The size of the flower appears substantial, suggesting it is fully bloomed and mature. The green leaves surrounding the flower are broad and elongated, providing a contrasting backdrop that highlights the flower's vivid color.\n\nDistinctive features include the uniformity of the petal arrangement and the consistent spacing between each petal, contributing to the flower's overall harmony and balance. The color gradient from the outer petals to the inner florets adds depth and visual interest.
