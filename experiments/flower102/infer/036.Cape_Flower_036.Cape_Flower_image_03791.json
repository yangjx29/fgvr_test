The centers of the flowers have a slightly darker pink tone.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals exhibit a smooth, slightly translucent quality, giving them a delicate and almost ethereal appearance. The edges of the petals are frayed and ruffled, adding to the intricate detail and texture.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: Each petal is elongated and slightly curved, with a gentle arching shape that contributes to the overall graceful form of the flower. The petals vary in size, with larger ones forming the outer layer and smaller ones nestled closer to the center. The central part of the flower consists of numerous thin, thread-like structures (likely stamens) that are a lighter pink compared to the petals.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the ruffled and frayed edge of each petal, which sets these flowers apart from more uniform or smooth-petaled varieties.

The color is uniform across most of the petals, though there are subtle variations in shade.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The petals have a smooth texture with a slight sheen, giving them a glossy look.

The petals are relatively large compared to the size of the flower's center, which consists of numerous stamens and pistils. The overall shape of the flower is somewhat star-like or starburst-like due to the arrangement of the petals.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the curvature and slight upward curling of the petals, which adds a dynamic and graceful quality to the flower.
