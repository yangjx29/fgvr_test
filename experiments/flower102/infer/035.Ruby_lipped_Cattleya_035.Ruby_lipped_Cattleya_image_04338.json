It is significantly larger than the sepals and petals surrounding it, making it the focal point of the flower.\n\nDistinctive features include the intricate veining pattern on the lip, which is a lighter shade of pink and creates a network of lines radiating outward from the center. This pattern is not uniform but varies in density and direction, adding complexity and uniqueness to the flower's appearance.

The center of the petals displays a subtle pattern of darker pink veins radiating outward.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals exhibit a smooth texture with a slight sheen, especially noticeable around the edges where the petal folds inward. The edges appear slightly ruffled or fringed, adding a delicate texture contrast to the otherwise smooth surface.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and flat, with a gentle curve along their length. The largest petal is positioned at the bottom, while the others are slightly smaller and arranged symmetrically above it. The overall shape is somewhat oval or elongated, typical of many orchid species.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The petal edges are not uniformly straight; instead, they have a wavy, ruffled appearance, which is a distinctive feature. This ruffling is more pronounced near the base of each petal, creating a layered effect.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The petal edges show a variation in color intensity, with the",
