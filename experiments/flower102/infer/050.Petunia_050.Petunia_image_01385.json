The edges of the petals are finely fringed, creating a textured look that adds depth and detail to the flower's surface. The color is a pure white, with subtle hints of pale yellow near the center, where the stamen is visible. The petals are broad and slightly overlapping, forming a cup-like shape typical of petunias. The overall size of the flower is medium, with a diameter that appears to be around 3-4 inches. The texture of the petals is smooth yet subtly ridged along the edges, enhancing the intricate beauty of the flower. There are no distinct patterns on the petals; instead, the focus is on the natural, organic form and the fine details of the petal structure. This petunia stands out due to its pristine white color and the delicate, ruffled texture of its petals, distinguishing it from other similar flowers like pansies or geraniums.",

The inner part of the petals has a more pronounced yellow tone.\n- **Texture**: The petals appear soft and slightly velvety, with a delicate, almost translucent quality. The edges of the petals have a slightly frilly appearance, giving them a textured look.\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are broad and rounded, with a slightly pointed tip. They are arranged in a symmetrical pattern around the central core, creating a full and rounded bloom. The size of the petals is medium, neither too large nor too small, making it a visually appealing flower.\n- **Unique Features**: The petal edges are not uniformly smooth; they have a gentle, wavy texture that adds to the flower's charm. The color gradient from white to yellow is consistent across multiple petals, enhancing the flower's natural beauty.\n- **Variations**: There are no significant variations in the petals' shape or size within the flower, maintaining a uniform and harmonious appearance.\n\nThis petunia's distinct combination of"
