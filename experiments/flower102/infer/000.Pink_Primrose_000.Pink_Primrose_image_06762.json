The center of each flower has a yellowish-green core, which contrasts with the pink petals.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals appear smooth and slightly glossy, giving them a delicate and almost velvety feel. The texture is consistent across all petals, contributing to the overall soft appearance of the flowers.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: Each flower has five rounded petals that are slightly overlapping. The petals are broad and flat, with a gentle curve at the edges. The size of the flowers is relatively small to medium, typically ranging from 2 to 3 inches in diameter.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the central yellow-green core surrounded by the pink petals.
