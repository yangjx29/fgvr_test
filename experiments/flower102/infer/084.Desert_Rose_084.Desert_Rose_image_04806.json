The edges of the petals are smooth and slightly ruffled, giving them a delicate, almost frilly appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The surface of the petals appears smooth with a slight sheen, indicating a healthy, well-maintained plant. There are no visible textures like hairs or scales, which helps in distinguishing it from plants with more textured petals.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: Each petal is broad and rounded at the base, tapering to a point. They are large and prominent, covering a significant portion of the flower's diameter. The symmetry is evident, with each petal mirroring the others in shape and size, contributing to the flower's balanced and harmonious look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The central part of the flower, where the stamens are located, is pale yellow and contrasts sharply with the red petals.

The center of the flower has a creamy yellow to white coloration, forming a star-like pattern.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The petals have a smooth texture and a slightly glossy appearance, especially noticeable under natural light.
