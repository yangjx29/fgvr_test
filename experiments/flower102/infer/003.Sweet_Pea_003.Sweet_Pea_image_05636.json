It is positioned at the center of the flower cluster, supporting the arrangement of the petals. The column is shorter than the petals, which extend outward in a fan-like pattern.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The central column is a defining feature of sweet peas, distinguishing them from other types of flowers like roses or lilies. Its position and structure are characteristic of the species, providing structural support for the petals while also contributing to the overall aesthetic appeal of the flower.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The soft pink color and the delicate ruffled texture of the petals are typical of sweet peas, particularly those in",

The petals exhibit a soft, velvety texture with a slight sheen, giving them a delicate and almost translucent appearance. The shape of the flower is symmetrical, with five large, overlapping petals forming a cup-like structure. Each petal has a slightly ruffled edge, adding to the intricate detail.\n\nThe size of the flower is medium, neither too small nor overly large, making it visually appealing within the context of the garden setting. The distinctive features include the layered arrangement of the petals and the gentle curve of each petal, which contributes to the flower's elegant form. The background shows other sweet peas and green foliage, which helps to highlight the flower's color and shape. Overall, the flower's unique combination of color, texture, and shape sets it apart from other similar categories of flowers."
