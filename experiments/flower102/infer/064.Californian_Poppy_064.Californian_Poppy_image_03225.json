The stamen has a slender, elongated shape, while the pistil is shorter and thicker.

The petals are large and fully open, showcasing a symmetrical arrangement around the central core.\n\nThe center of the flower displays a darker yellow hue with a subtle pattern of fine lines radiating outward, which contrasts nicely with the lighter yellow of the petals. This central area is slightly raised, creating a focal point that draws attention inward.\n\nThe petal edges show slight variations in thickness and curvature, adding to the natural beauty and uniqueness of the flower.
