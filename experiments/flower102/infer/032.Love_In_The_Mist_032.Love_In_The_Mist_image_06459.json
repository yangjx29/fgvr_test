The petals are elongated and slightly pointed, with a smooth surface that contrasts with the intricate, spiky green sepals surrounding them. The center of the flower is dark, almost black, with a prominent, star-like structure composed of numerous thin, white filaments that extend outward, creating a complex and intricate pattern.

The sepals are a deep maroon or burgundy color, contrasting sharply with the petals.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The petals have a smooth, slightly translucent appearance, giving them a delicate and ethereal look. The sepals are covered in fine, soft hairs, adding a fuzzy texture. The central part of the flower, where the stamens are located, has a greenish hue and is densely packed, creating a textured core.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The petals are petaloid (leaf-like), with five distinct petals arranged in a star-like pattern. Each petal is slightly pointed at the tip and curves gently outward. The sepals are long and narrow, extending beyond the petals, and are also petaloid in shape. The overall size of the flower is small to medium, typical for this species.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the presence of the fine, thread-like appendages (pistillate bracts) that"
