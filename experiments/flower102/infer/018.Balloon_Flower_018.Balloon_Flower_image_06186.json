The center of the flower is white, with prominent stamens extending outward, which contrasts sharply with the deep purple of the petals.

The center of the flower is adorned with prominent white stamens, which stand out against the rich purple hue, adding a striking contrast.\n\nThe flower's shape is distinctly pentagonal, with five pointed petals that curve gently outward, giving it a rounded yet open appearance. The size of the flower appears substantial compared to the surrounding green leaves, which are broad and have serrated edges, providing a lush backdrop that enhances the flower's prominence.\n\nUnique to this species, the balloon flower has a unique structure where the petals are fused at the base, forming a tube-like structure that can be inflated like a balloon when the flower matures. This feature, though not visible in the current image, is a key characteristic that distinguishes it from other similar flowers such as the balloon vine (Cardiospermum halicacabum) or the balloon plant (Solanum viarum).\n\nIn summary, the balloon flower's vivid purple color, textured petals, star-shaped"
