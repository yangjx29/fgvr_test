Here's a detailed description of their visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The petals are a rich, deep pink with a subtle gradient, transitioning slightly towards a lighter shade at the edges. The color is uniform across the visible petals.\n\n- **Texture**: The petals appear smooth with a slight sheen, suggesting a delicate, almost velvety texture. There are no visible veins or intricate patterns on the surface, which contributes to the petals' soft appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: Each petal is broad and rounded, with a gentle curve that gives them a soft, almost bell-like shape. The petals are large and overlapping, creating a full and lush appearance. The size of the petals varies slightly among the different blooms, but they are generally consistent within each flower.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The flowers have a distinctive ruffled or frilly edge along the outer rim of the petals, adding a delicate and elegant touch.
