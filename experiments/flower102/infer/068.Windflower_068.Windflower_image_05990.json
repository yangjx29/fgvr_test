The anthers (the pollen-producing part) appear bright yellow, while the filaments (the stalks supporting the anthers) are a slightly lighter shade, almost pale yellow.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The anthers have a fine, granular texture, typical of pollen, which is essential for reproduction. There is no visible pattern on the anthers themselves; they are uniformly colored and textured. The filaments are smooth and slender, extending outward from the base of the flower.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The stamens are numerous, densely packed around the central pistil (female reproductive part). They are relatively small compared to the overall size of the flower, with each filament being thin and elongated. The anthers are small, round, and clustered together, forming a compact structure.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The arrangement of the stamens is particularly distinctive.
