The anthers (the pollen-producing parts) are a pale yellow and are densely packed together.\n\n- **Texture**: The stamens have a soft, feathery texture, with individual filaments that are delicate and slightly curved. The anthers are smooth and rounded at their tips.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are small, dark red speckles scattered across the surface of the stamens, adding a speckled pattern that contrasts with the lighter color of the filaments.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The stamens are numerous and tightly clustered, forming a central column within the flower. They are relatively small compared to the overall size of the flower, but they are prominent due to their dense arrangement and contrasting colors.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the light yellow filaments, the dark red speckles, and the delicate, feathery texture makes this center stand out.
