There are no visible patterns or textures on the body, maintaining a smooth and polished look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The SUV has a robust and boxy shape typical of SUVs, with a slightly elevated stance due to its off-road capabilities. It appears to be mid-sized compared to compact SUVs, offering a balance between practicality and comfort. The overall proportions are symmetrical, with a long hood and a short rear deck.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n  - The front grille is a prominent feature, with a chrome surround and a central emblem that is characteristic of Buick vehicles.\n  - The headlights are rectangular and positioned low on the front, contributing to a strong and assertive front-end design.\n  - The side profile includes black side steps, which add a touch of ruggedness and utility, suggesting the vehicle is designed for both on-road and off-road use.\n  - The wheels are alloy, with a multi-spoke design that complements the overall aesthetic of the vehicle.\n\n"
