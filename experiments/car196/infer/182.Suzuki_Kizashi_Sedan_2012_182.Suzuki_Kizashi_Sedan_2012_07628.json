Inside the headlight, there appears to be a single round bulb, which is illuminated, giving off a bright yellowish-white light.\n\nThe headlight is positioned symmetrically on either side of the front grille, which is a prominent feature of the car's design. The grille itself is black with a textured pattern that resembles a honeycomb or mesh, adding a distinct visual element to the front fascia. The Suzuki logo is prominently displayed at the center of the grille, serving as a brand identifier.\n\nThe headlight's size is relatively large compared to the overall dimensions of the car, making it a noticeable part of the vehicle's front profile. There are no additional features such as fog lights or daytime running lights integrated into the main headlight assembly, which suggests a focus on standard lighting functionality rather than advanced features.
