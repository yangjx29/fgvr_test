The windows are also rectangular, with the front windshield being larger than the rear windows, which is standard for passenger vehicles. The side mirrors are integrated into the door panels, adding to the streamlined look.\n- **Unique Features**: The car has five-spoke alloy wheels, which are a distinctive feature. The wheels appear to be of a standard size for this type of vehicle, providing a balance between style and functionality.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The car has a clean and simple design, with no visible chrome accents or elaborate detailing. This minimalist approach gives it a modern and practical appearance.\n\nOverall, the vehicle's side profile is characterized by its smooth maroon paint, rectangular door and window shapes, and the integration of the side mirrors into the door panels. These features help distinguish it as a practical and stylish sedan.",

The Chevrolet logo is prominently displayed in the center, featuring a stylized \"C\" in white. The badge is relatively small compared to the overall size of the car.\n\n- **Taillights**: The taillights are integrated into the rear bumper and are rectangular in shape. They have a clear lens with a subtle gradient effect, transitioning from a lighter shade near the top to a darker shade towards the bottom. The taillights are positioned symmetrically on either side of the trunk, with a slight curve along the edge of the bumper. The design is sleek and modern, consistent with the Malibu's styling.\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The car's body is painted in a deep maroon color, which appears smooth and glossy under natural light.
