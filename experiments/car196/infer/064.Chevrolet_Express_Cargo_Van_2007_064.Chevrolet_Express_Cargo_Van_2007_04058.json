The size is proportional to the overall dimensions of the van, providing ample visibility.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The surface of the tail lights seems smooth without any visible textures or patterns.\n   - **Unique Features**: There are no distinct markings or logos on the tail lights themselves, which are standard for this type of vehicle.\n\n2. **Rear Badge**:\n   - **Model Identification**: The rear badge is located near the center of the rear door, just above the wheel well.\n   - **Color and Texture**: The badge appears to be metallic or chrome in color, with a reflective surface that suggests a polished metal finish.\n   - **Shape and Size**: It is rectangular and relatively small compared to the overall size of the van.
