It features the Chrysler logo prominently at the top, which is a stylized \"C\" in a circular emblem. Below the logo, the word \"Sebring\" is written in a sans-serif font, also in a metallic color that matches the badge's finish. The text is evenly spaced and aligned horizontally, making it easy to read.\n\nThere are no additional patterns or colors on the badge; it maintains a monochromatic appearance with the metallic sheen providing the primary visual distinction. The badge's size and placement make it distinct yet unobtrusive, serving as a clear indicator of the car's make and model without being overly large or obtrusive.",

It is positioned centrally at the back of the vehicle, slightly above the taillight area. The emblem's size is relatively small compared to the overall dimensions of the car but is prominent enough to be noticeable upon close inspection. There are no visible patterns or text on the emblem itself; it is a simple, clean design that reflects light, indicating a polished surface. This emblem helps to identify the make of the car, distinguishing it from other brands through its unique shape and material.",
