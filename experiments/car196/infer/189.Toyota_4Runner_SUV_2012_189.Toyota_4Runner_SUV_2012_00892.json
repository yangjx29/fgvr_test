They appear to be a dark gray color, matching the body of the SUV. The texture seems smooth with no visible patterns, providing a clean and uniform look. The flares extend slightly beyond the tires, enhancing the vehicle's off-road appearance.\n\n- **Wheel Design**: The wheels are silver alloy with a five-spoke design. Each spoke is thin and evenly spaced, contributing to a modern and sleek aesthetic. The center caps are also silver, maintaining consistency with the overall color scheme. The tires are black with visible treads, indicating they are designed for both on-road and light off-road use. The tires have a noticeable sidewall marking \"AT20,\" suggesting they are all-terrain tires suitable for various driving conditions.\n\nThese features collectively give the Toyota 4Runner a robust and capable look, distinguishing it from other SUVs in terms of its rugged styling and functional design elements.",
