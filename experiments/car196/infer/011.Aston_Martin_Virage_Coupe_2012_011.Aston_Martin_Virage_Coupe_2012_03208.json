The taillights are rectangular in shape, with a subtle gradient effect that enhances their three-dimensional look.\n\nThe rear bumper is wide and low, contributing to the car's sporty aesthetic. It features two circular exhaust outlets on either side, which are chrome-finished and add a touch of elegance. The bumper itself has a matte black finish, which complements the vibrant orange paint of the car. The license plate is mounted centrally on the rear bumper, and it appears to be a standard California license plate with a white background and blue lettering.\n\nOverall, the combination of the red taillights, the black bumper, and the orange body creates a visually striking contrast, making the car stand out as a high-performance sports car.
