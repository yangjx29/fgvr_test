            "The image shows the side profile of a white Chevrolet Avalanche, focusing on the area near the rear wheel. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The vehicle is predominantly white with a black bed liner visible in the truck bed. The paint appears smooth and uniform without any noticeable texture or patterns.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The cab is extended, which is characteristic of an Avalanche model, providing additional passenger space compared to a standard pickup truck. The bed is relatively short, as indicated by the proximity of the cab to the rear wheels.\n\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - The Chevrolet logo is prominently displayed on the tailgate.\n  - The bed liner is black, contrasting sharply with the white body.\n  - The rear window is tinted, adding a subtle detail to the vehicle's appearance.\n  - The tailgate has a slight upward curve at the top, typical of the Avalanche design.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**:\n  - The Avalanche model is known for its dual-cab configuration, offering both passenger and cargo space.\n  - The bed length is shorter than that of a full-size pickup, making it suitable for various uses such as carrying smaller loads or as a family vehicle.\n\nThis combination of features—white body, black bed liner, extended cab,",

However, based on the visible rear portion, we can infer some details about the front:\n\n- **Color**: The vehicle appears to be white with a black bed liner on the truck bed.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The body panels seem smooth and painted uniformly, without any visible textures or patterns. The bed liner has a matte finish, typical for utility purposes.\n- **Shape and Size**: The vehicle is a full-size pickup truck, characterized by its large size and robust build. The rear design includes a prominent taillight assembly and a chrome exhaust tip, which are indicative of a Chevrolet Avalanche model.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The Chevrolet logo is visible on the tailgate, confirming the brand. The rear bumper and taillights have a clean, modern design, consistent with late-model trucks. The bed liner suggests it may be used for carrying cargo, which is a common feature in trucks.\n\nFor a detailed description of the front, one would need to see the front grille, headlights, and badge, which are not present in this image."
