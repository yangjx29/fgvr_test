The headlight shape is angular, with a sharp, almost rectangular outline that contributes to the car's contemporary aesthetic. The size of the headlights is proportionate to the overall vehicle, providing ample illumination while maintaining a streamlined appearance.\n\nThe bumper design is equally distinctive. It incorporates a black lower section with integrated fog lights, which are positioned symmetrically on either side of the front grille. The grille itself is a prominent feature, with a horizontal chrome bar that spans across the center, flanked by two vertical chrome bars on each side. This grille design adds a touch of elegance and sophistication to the front fascia. The bumper also includes a subtle chrome trim along the bottom edge, enhancing the car's polished look.\n\nOverall, the combination of the angular headlights, the elegant grille, and the sleek bumper design makes the Acura TLX stand out as a sophisticated and modern vehicle. These elements collectively contribute to a cohesive and stylish front-end appearance that sets it apart from other sedans in its category.",
