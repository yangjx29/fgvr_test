This color choice enhances the sporty and sleek appearance typical of Audi vehicles.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The grille has a mesh-like pattern with horizontal bars that create a grid-like texture. The bars are evenly spaced and appear to be made of metal, contributing to a robust and modern look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is rectangular and spans almost the entire width of the front bumper. It is slightly larger than the headlights, making it a focal point of the vehicle's design.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The grille features the iconic four-ring Audi logo prominently placed at the center.

There are no distinct colors other than the white of the car body and the black trim around the headlight area.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The surface of the headlights seems smooth and glossy, reflecting light, indicating a polished finish. There are no visible textures or patterns within the headlight itself; it appears as a solid, clear lens.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The headlights are large compared to the overall size of the car, occupying a significant portion of the front fascia. Their rectangular shape is bordered by a black trim that adds contrast and defines their shape clearly.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The headlights have a dual-element design, with a smaller inner section (possibly for high beams) and a larger outer section (for low beams).
