Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Headlights**: The headlights are rectangular with a clear lens, positioned symmetrically on either side of the grille. They have a clean, angular shape that contrasts with the rounded edges of the grille. The headlight housing appears to be made of a matte black material, which gives it a sleek and modern look.\n\n- **Bumper Design**: The bumper is large and robust, typical of the Hummer brand, designed for off-road capability. It features a prominent black plastic lower section that extends outward, providing protection against impacts. The bumper also includes integrated fog lights, which are circular and located below the main headlights. These fog lights are smaller compared to the main headlights but still contribute to the vehicle's aggressive stance.\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The vehicle has a dark green body with a matte finish, giving it a rugged appearance. The black plastic components, including the bumper and lower grille sections, contrast sharply with the green body, enhancing the vehicle's bold aesthetic.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Hummer H2's front end is characterized by its large, square grille with vertical slats, which is a hallmark of",
