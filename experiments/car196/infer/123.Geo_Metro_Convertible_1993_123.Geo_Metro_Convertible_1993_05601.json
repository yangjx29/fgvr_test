There are no visible patterns or textures on the lens itself.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The tail light is rectangular in shape, typical for many car models. It is positioned horizontally along the rear edge of the car, slightly towards the center.\n   - **Unique Features**: The black housing around the lens contrasts sharply with the yellow body of the car, making it stand out. There are no additional decorative elements or unique designs on the tail light.\n\n2. **Rear Emblem**:\n   - **Location**: The emblem is located on the rear door, near the bottom right corner when viewed from the side.\n   - **Color**: The emblem is silver or chrome in color, which reflects light and gives it a metallic appearance.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The emblem has a smooth, polished surface with a reflective quality.\n   - **Shape and Size**:"
