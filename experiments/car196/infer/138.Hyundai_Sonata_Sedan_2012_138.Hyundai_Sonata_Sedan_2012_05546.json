The grille is slightly curved at the top, adding a subtle dynamic element to its otherwise straight lines.\n\nThe Hyundai emblem is centrally located within the grille. It is a simple, circular shape with a silver outline and a small, raised, three-dimensional logo inside. The emblem is relatively small compared to the overall size of the grille but stands out due to its metallic sheen and distinct contrast against the chrome background.\n\nThe grille's texture appears smooth and polished, reflecting light, which enhances its visual appeal.

There are no visible textures or patterns within the lenses themselves, suggesting a clean and sleek design.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The headlights are rectangular in shape, typical of many sedan designs, and are positioned at the front corners of the vehicle. They are relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, providing ample illumination.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The headlight design includes a clear lens that covers the bulb, with a subtle chrome or metallic accent around the edges, adding a touch of elegance. The fog lights, located below the main headlights, are also rectangular and integrated seamlessly into the bumper design.\n\n5. **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The fog lights are smaller than the main headlights and are likely designed to provide additional lighting for low-visibility conditions. They share a similar rectangular shape and are positioned lower on the vehicle, enhancing their functionality for fog",
