It is positioned horizontally along the lower edge of the rear panel.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The badge features a logo, likely representing the manufacturer (Chevrolet), which is a silver or chrome-colored emblem. This logo is centered within the dark background of the badge.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: There are no additional text or markings visible on the badge apart from the logo.
