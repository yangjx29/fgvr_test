This ribbing is consistent across the entire width of the grille.\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is rectangular and spans the width of the front fascia, covering the area between the headlights and the bumper. It is slightly larger than the headlights but not overly so, maintaining a balanced look.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The grille design is characteristic of Ford vehicles from this era, featuring a simple yet functional aesthetic. There are no additional emblems or logos prominently displayed on the grille itself.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The headlights are integrated into the grille, with clear lens covers that are typical of minivans.
