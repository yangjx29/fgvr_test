It is relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle, positioned centrally at the front bumper. The grille has a subtle, slightly textured appearance, possibly indicating a fine mesh or perforated design. There is no visible emblem or logo on the grille itself; however, the car's bodywork suggests it is a Honda, as indicated by the \"Type R\" badge on the side, which is typically associated with high-performance models. The grille's shape is rectangular and integrated seamlessly into the front fascia, contributing to the car's sporty aesthetic.",
            "The side skirts and wheel arches of the car in the image are black, contrasting with the bright yellow body of the vehicle. The side skirts appear to be integrated into the car's design, extending from the front fender to the rear fender, providing a sleek and aerodynamic look. They have a smooth, glossy finish, which reflects light and enhances their visual prominence.\n\nThe wheel arches are also black and extend slightly outward from the tires, creating a subtle flared effect. This design element is common in performance-oriented vehicles, as it can improve the car's handling by allowing for wider tires without compromising the car's overall width. The wheel arches match the side skirts in color and texture, maintaining a cohesive appearance.\n\nThere are no visible patterns or unique designs on the side skirts or wheel arches; they are simple and functional, designed primarily for aesthetic appeal and aerodynamics rather than intricate detailing. The size of the side skirts and wheel arches is proportional to the car's overall dimensions, neither too large nor too small, ensuring they complement the vehicle's sporty profile.\n\nOverall, the black side skirts and wheel arches serve to accentuate the car's sporty character while maintaining a clean and streamlined look.",
            "The vehicle in the image is a yellow Honda Integra Type R, identifiable by the \"Type R\" badge on the side. The tail lights are not clearly visible in this image, but typically for this model, they are located at the rear corners of the car, integrated into the bumper area.\n\nThe rear spoiler is a prominent feature, painted in the same bright yellow as the body. It is a fixed spoiler, likely made of plastic or carbon fiber, and is positioned low on the trunk lid, extending slightly outward. Its shape is aerodynamic, designed to improve downforce at high speeds. The spoiler's size is relatively large compared to the overall dimensions of the car, enhancing its sporty appearance.\n\nThe wheels are silver with a multi-spoke design, which contrasts nicely with the yellow body. The tires appear to be performance-oriented, suitable for the Type R's sporty nature. There are no visible modifications or unique features on the rear of the car other than the standard Type R branding and the spoiler."
