The badge itself likely has a metallic or glossy finish, reflecting light and giving it a premium look. It may feature the \"Genesis\" name in a stylized font, possibly with a logo above it. The badge's shape is typically rectangular or oval, adhering to the aesthetic standards of luxury vehicles. If there are any variations or special characteristics, they might include intricate detailing or a subtle color gradient, but these details cannot be confirmed without a clearer view."
