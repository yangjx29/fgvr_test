The windows are proportionate to the overall size of the vehicle, with a slightly curved rear window that adds to the aerodynamic look.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The front grille is relatively small and integrated into the bumper, with a simple horizontal bar design. The headlights are rectangular and positioned low on the front, contributing to a modern aesthetic. The side mirrors are integrated into the door panels, and the wheels have a simple, multi-spoke design.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The hatchback has a roof rack installed, suggesting it might be used for carrying luggage or outdoor gear.
