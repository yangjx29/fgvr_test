There are no visible scratches or discoloration.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The headlights are rectangular with a slightly curved top edge, following the sleek design of the car. They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the front grille.\n   - **Unique Features**: The headlights have integrated daytime running lights (DRLs) that are visible as thin, horizontal lines at the bottom of each headlight. These DRLs are a common feature in modern cars for improved visibility during low-light conditions.\n\n2. **Bumper**:\n   - **Color**: The bumper is black, contrasting sharply with the white body of the car.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The bumper has a matte finish, which is typical for bumpers to prevent glare and enhance safety by making the car less reflective.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The bumper is wide",
