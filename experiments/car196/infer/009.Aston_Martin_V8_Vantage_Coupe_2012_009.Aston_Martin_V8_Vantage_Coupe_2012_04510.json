The grille appears to have a smooth, polished texture, giving it a refined look.\n\nThe headlights are integrated into the grille area, positioned symmetrically on either side. They are elongated and angular, contributing to the car's sporty and aggressive aesthetic. The headlights themselves seem to be made of a glossy material, reflecting light and adding to the overall polished appearance of the car. There are no visible patterns or textures on the headlights; they maintain a smooth, continuous surface.\n\nThe grille and headlights together form a cohesive unit that enhances the car's modern and high-performance look. The dark color of the grille and the bright yellow of the car body create a striking contrast, making the front end visually striking and distinctive. This combination sets the car apart from other vehicles in terms of both style and performance-oriented design.",

The taillights are integrated into the rear fender, with a smooth, continuous curve that flows seamlessly into the body. They appear to be a single, elongated unit with a subtle gradient from a darker shade at the top to a lighter shade at the bottom, suggesting a modern and sophisticated design.\n\nThe rear bumper is wide and low, contributing to the car's aggressive stance. It has a matte black finish that contrasts sharply with the bright yellow paint of the car. The bumper includes integrated side skirts that extend outward, enhancing the car's sporty appearance. There are no visible exhaust pipes, which might indicate a rear-mid-engine layout, common in high-performance sports cars like this one.\n\nThe overall design is clean and minimalistic, with no visible chrome accents, which helps maintain the car's sporty and modern aesthetic. The rear design is designed to be both functional for performance and visually striking, distinguishing it from more conservative or luxury-oriented designs."
