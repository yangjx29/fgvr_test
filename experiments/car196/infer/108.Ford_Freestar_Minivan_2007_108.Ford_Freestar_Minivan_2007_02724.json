There are no visible logos or emblems within the grille itself, giving it a clean and uncluttered look. The edges of the grille are slightly rounded, contributing to a sleek profile.

Its shape is rectangular and boxy, typical of minivans, with a slightly curved roofline that slopes gently towards the rear.

The texture seems smooth and uniform, without any visible patterns. They are positioned at the rear corners of the vehicle, symmetrically placed on either side. Each tail light is relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle, which is typical for minivans like the one shown.\n\nA distinctive feature is the clear lens covering each light, which allows the red color of the brake lights to be seen when illuminated. There are no visible indicators of additional lighting such as turn signals or reverse lights within these units. The design is simple and functional, consistent with many minivan models. No unique or special characteristics stand out beyond their standard appearance."
