The windows have a tinted appearance, which adds to the overall sophisticated look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The car exhibits a classic touring wagon shape with a long, sloping rear end and a prominent roofline. The wheels are large in proportion to the car, with a multi-spoke alloy design that complements the vehicle's sporty yet elegant aesthetic. The tires appear to be standard for the model, providing a balanced stance.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most noticeable feature is the BMW badge prominently displayed on the rear door, indicating the brand. The taillights are integrated into the rear bumper, with a design that is characteristic of BMW models from that era. The side mirrors are body-colored, blending seamlessly with the car’s exterior.\n\n-",

It has a matte finish compared to the glossy tail lights, giving it a more understated look. The bumper includes a small, integrated exhaust pipe on the right side, which is a distinctive feature. This pipe is also matte and blends seamlessly with the bumper's design.
