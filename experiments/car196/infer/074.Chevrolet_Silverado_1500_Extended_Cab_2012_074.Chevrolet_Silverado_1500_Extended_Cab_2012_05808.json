The wheel's surface is smooth and shiny, indicating a metallic material.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The tire is standard-sized for a full-size pickup truck, fitting well within the vehicle's wheel wells. The wheel is proportionate to the truck, with a diameter that allows it to rotate smoothly while providing adequate ground clearance.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The wheel design includes a five-spoke pattern, which is common in many truck models.
