The headlight shape is elongated horizontally, which is typical for many contemporary sedan designs.\n\nThe bumper is integrated into the front fascia and features a subtle chrome accent running along the bottom edge, adding a touch of elegance. The bumper itself is relatively wide and flat, with a smooth, untextured surface. It houses the fog lights, which are located centrally below the main headlights, and these are also rectangular and have a clear lens. The overall design of the bumper is streamlined and cohesive with the rest of the car's front end.\n\nThe grille is located centrally on the front of the car and is part of the bumper assembly.
