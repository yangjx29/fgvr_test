The text appears to be in a standard font, likely alphanumeric, and is clearly legible against the white background. There are no unique patterns or textures on the plate itself; it is a plain, standard license plate design.\n\nIn terms of size, the license plate is proportionate to the front of the car, fitting within the typical placement for such a vehicle. Its shape is consistent with standard European license plates, which are generally longer than they are tall.\n\nThere are no distinctive features or variations on the license plate that set it apart from other standard license plates.
