They are circular in shape and relatively large compared to the van's body, which is typical for vehicles designed to carry cargo or passengers efficiently.\n\nThe wheels have a simple, metallic design with a silver finish. They feature a multi-spoke pattern, which is common in commercial vans for both aesthetic appeal and structural integrity. The spokes are evenly spaced and connected by a central hub, which is also silver in color. There are no visible signs of unique or distinctive features on the wheels, such as logos or additional designs, making them appear quite standard and utilitarian.\n\nIn summary, the tires are black, round, and robust, while the wheels are silver with a multi-spoke design, contributing to the overall practical and functional appearance of the van."
