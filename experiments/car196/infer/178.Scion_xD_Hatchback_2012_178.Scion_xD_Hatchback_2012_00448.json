            "The front grille of the vehicle in the image is black with a textured finish, giving it a slightly rough appearance. The grille is relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, occupying a significant portion of the front fascia. It features a horizontal bar design that extends across the width of the grille, contributing to a modern and sleek aesthetic.\n\nThe Scion emblem is prominently displayed at the center of the grille. It is circular in shape and appears to be made of a shiny, metallic material, reflecting light and adding a premium look. The emblem's design includes a stylized \"S\" logo, which is characteristic of Scion vehicles. The emblem's size is moderate, making it easily noticeable but not overly large, maintaining a balance with the rest of the grille's design.\n\nThe combination of the black grille with the metallic Scion emblem creates a striking contrast, enhancing the vehicle's sporty and contemporary appearance. This design choice helps distinguish the car from other similar models by emphasizing its brand identity and modern styling cues.",
            "The headlights and fog lights of the vehicle in the image are black with a glossy finish, reflecting light and surroundings. The headlight shape is angular, with a slightly curved design that tapers towards the center. The fog lights are integrated into the lower part of the front bumper, positioned symmetrically on either side of the main headlight assembly. They appear to be rectangular in shape, with a smaller size compared to the main headlights. The fog lights have a clear lens cover, which contrasts with the black housing. There are no visible patterns or textures on the headlights or fog lights, giving them a sleek and modern appearance. The overall design is consistent with contemporary automotive styling, emphasizing functionality and aerodynamics.",
            "The side mirrors of the vehicle in the image are black with a smooth, glossy finish, indicating they are likely made of plastic or painted metal. They are positioned at the front corners of the car's doors and are relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle. The side mirrors have a simple, rounded shape without any intricate patterns or designs.\n\nThe door handles are also black and appear to be made of a durable material, possibly plastic or painted metal, matching the color of the side mirrors. They are located on the lower part of the doors, near the bottom edge, and are designed for easy access. The handles have a smooth, flat surface with no visible textures or patterns.\n\nThese features—black color, smooth texture, and simple shapes—are consistent across both the side mirrors and the door handles, contributing to a cohesive design aesthetic. The lack of any unique or distinctive features suggests these components are standard and functional rather than decorative.",
            "The rearview mirror is located on the driver's side of the vehicle, positioned near the front door. It appears to be a standard design with a black frame, which matches the overall color scheme of the car. The mirror itself has a smooth, reflective surface, typical of modern automotive mirrors, designed for clear visibility.\n\nThe rear window is large and spans the back of the vehicle, providing ample visibility for passengers. It is tinted, which is common for privacy and sun protection purposes. The tinting is uniform across the window, without any visible patterns or textures. The window frame is also black, consistent with the car's exterior color.\n\nNo unique or distinctive features are immediately apparent on the rearview mirror or the rear window that would set them apart from those found on other vehicles. The mirror and window are standard components, designed for functionality rather than aesthetic differentiation."
