They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the front grille.\n   - **Unique Features**: The headlights feature integrated daytime running lights (DRLs) that are visible as thin, horizontal lines above the main beam lights. This adds to the vehicle's contemporary look.\n\n2. **Bumper Design**:\n   - **Color**: The bumper is black, contrasting with the silver body of the car.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The bumper has a matte finish, which is common for bumpers to provide a more rugged and durable appearance.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The bumper is wide and low, extending slightly below the headlights and above the grille. It includes a central air intake area, which is likely designed to improve airflow and cooling for the engine.\n   -",
