            "The vehicle in the image is a black Toyota 4Runner, identifiable by its distinct shape and size relative to other SUVs. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color, Texture, and Patterns**: The vehicle is painted in a glossy black finish with a smooth, reflective surface. There are no visible patterns or textures apart from the subtle reflections on the paint.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The 4Runner has a boxy, robust design typical of SUVs, with a high ground clearance and a long wheelbase. It appears larger than a compact SUV but smaller than a full-sized SUV like a Sequoia. The body lines are straight and angular, contributing to its rugged appearance.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: \n  - The front grille is large and features a prominent Toyota emblem at the center.\n  - The headlights are rectangular and positioned low on the front, giving it a strong, purposeful look.\n  - The side mirrors are large and integrated into the door panels, enhancing visibility.\n  - The wheels have a simple, five-spoke design with a silver finish that contrasts with the black body.\n  - The rear has a spare tire mounted on the back, which is a common feature on SUVs for off-road capability.\n\n-",

There are no visible signs of rust or discoloration, indicating they are well-maintained.\n\n2. **Texture and Patterns**: The surface of the wheels has a smooth, polished texture typical of alloy wheels. There are no visible scratches or dents, suggesting they are in good condition. The pattern consists of multiple spokes radiating from the center hub, which is a common design for many vehicle models.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The wheels are circular in shape and appear to be of a standard size for an SUV, fitting the vehicle's proportions. They are mounted on the vehicle's axles, which are not visible in the image but can be inferred from the wheel placement.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The wheels do not have any unique markings, logos, or designs that set them apart from other standard alloy wheels.
