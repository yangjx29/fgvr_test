The grille is chrome, adding a touch of contrast against the black body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The headlights are rectangular and positioned symmetrically on either side of the grille. They are relatively large compared to the overall size of the vehicle, contributing to the Expedition's robust and commanding presence. The grille is wide and prominent, featuring horizontal slats that are characteristic of Ford's design language at the time.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The Expedition's front fascia includes a prominent chrome grille with horizontal bars, flanked by large, rectangular headlights. The bumper is also chrome, complementing the grille. The overall shape is boxy and angular, typical of SUVs designed for utility and off-road capability.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The Expedition in the image does not appear to have any special or unique modifications.

The windows are large and evenly spaced along the sides, contributing to the vehicle's imposing presence. The front and rear sections are slightly elevated compared to the middle, creating a slightly raked windshield and rear end.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most noticeable feature is the chrome grille at the front, which contrasts sharply with the black body. The headlights are integrated into the grille, and there are additional chrome accents around the lower front bumper and along the sides near the wheel wells. The wheels have a multi-spoke design with a silver finish that complements the black body.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The SUV has sliding doors on the passenger side, which is a common feature in this model.
