The side profile is straight and unadorned, with no prominent curves or embellishments. The windows are rectangular and appear to be tinted slightly, providing privacy while maintaining visibility.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - The door handles are integrated into the smooth body lines, blending seamlessly with the car’s design.\n   - The windows are framed by black trim, which contrasts subtly with the silver body.\n   - The side mirrors are also black, matching the window frames for a cohesive look.\n\n5. **Variations or Special Characteristics**:\n   - The wheels are simple in design, featuring a five-spoke alloy pattern that adds a touch",
