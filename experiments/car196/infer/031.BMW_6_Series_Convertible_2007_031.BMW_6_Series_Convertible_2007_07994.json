The emblem is slightly raised above the grille surface, making it stand out against the silver background. Its size is proportionate to the overall front grille, serving as a focal point that immediately identifies the vehicle as a BMW.\n\nThe grille's shape is rectangular, with a width that spans almost the entire front face of the car, except for the central area where the emblem is placed.

There are no visible variations or special characteristics in the grille itself; it maintains a consistent design typical of BMW models during that era.",
