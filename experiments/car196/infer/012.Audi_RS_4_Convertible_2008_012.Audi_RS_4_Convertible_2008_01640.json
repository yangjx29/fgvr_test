The taillights are rectangular with a subtle gradient effect, transitioning from a darker shade at the top to a lighter hue at the bottom, giving them a three-dimensional appearance. The color is a deep, almost black, which contrasts sharply with the car's body, enhancing its sporty look.\n\nThe taillights are integrated into the rear bumper, which has a smooth, glossy finish that reflects light, adding to the car's sophisticated look. The bumper itself is wide and low, contributing to the vehicle's aggressive stance. The rear design includes a subtle diffuser at the bottom, which helps to channel air away from the rear wheels, reducing drag and improving aerodynamics.\n\nThe taillights have a distinctive pattern with a series of horizontal lines that create a segmented effect, adding to their unique character. There are no visible reflections or highlights on the taillights, suggesting a matte or semi-matte finish that complements the overall dark theme of the car.\n\nIn summary, the taillights are characterized by their sleek, rectangular shape, deep black color, subtle gradient effect, and distinctive segmented pattern, all of which contribute to the car's premium and sporty appearance"
