The grille itself is black, which contrasts sharply with the silver trim surrounding it.\n\nThe GMC logo is centrally positioned at the top of the grille. It is a three-dimensional emblem with the letters \"GMC\" in bold, red font. The logo's design is sleek and modern, with a slight curve to the letters, adding a touch of elegance to the otherwise utilitarian appearance of the grille.\n\nThe grille's shape is rectangular, with a width that spans almost the entire width of the front bumper. Its size is large enough to cover most of the lower part of the vehicle's hood, making it a defining characteristic of the vehicle's front end. The grille's design is functional yet stylish, serving both an aesthetic and aerodynamic purpose.\n\nNo other brands or logos are visible on the grille, making it a clear indicator of the vehicle's make and model.
