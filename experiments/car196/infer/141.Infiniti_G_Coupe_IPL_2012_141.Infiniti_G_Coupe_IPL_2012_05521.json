Its size is small relative to the grille itself but is proportionate to the car's overall design. The emblem's surface is smooth and highly reflective, catching the light and adding to the car's luxurious aesthetic.

There are no visible textures or patterns other than the natural reflections of light.\n- **Shape and Size**: The car has a sleek, aerodynamic shape typical of sports coupes. It is compact yet elongated, with a low profile and a streamlined silhouette. The wheels are large and sporty, complementing the overall design.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The car features a prominent front grille with a logo, which is characteristic of luxury brands. The side mirrors are integrated into the car's body, enhancing the sleek look. The windows are tinted, providing privacy while maintaining a modern aesthetic.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The car has dual door handles, one for each side, which are flush with the body. The windows are slightly curved, adding to the aerodynamic design. The tires are wide and low-profile, further emphasizing the sporty nature of the vehicle",

There is a subtle gradient effect where the light transitions from a darker shade near the edges to a slightly lighter tone towards the center, giving them a three-dimensional appearance.\n\nThe rear bumper is integrated into the overall design of the car, blending seamlessly with the body. It has a smooth, polished surface with a metallic finish that reflects light, enhancing the car's sporty aesthetic. The bumper is relatively wide and extends horizontally across the back of the car, providing a stable base for the taillights and contributing to the car's aerodynamic profile.\n\nNo additional distinctive features or variations are immediately apparent in the taillights or bumper area, as they maintain a consistent and clean design typical of modern sports coupes. The overall appearance is streamlined and focused on a sporty, performance-oriented look."
