The color is consistent across the entire grille area.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The grille has a horizontal bar pattern with a slightly raised, ribbed texture. This texture adds depth and a sense of quality to the design.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is large and prominently positioned at the front of the vehicle, spanning almost the full width of the car's front fascia. It is flanked by two large, circular headlights on either side.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The BMW logo is centrally located within the grille, serving as a clear brand identifier. The headlights have a modern, angular design with clear lenses and a subtle curve at the top, contributing to the vehicle's contemporary look.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The headlights feature LED daytime running lights integrated into the lower part of the headlight assembly, which is a common feature in newer models.

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The vehicle is painted in a light beige or silver metallic color with a smooth finish. There are no visible textures or patterns on the bodywork.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The car has a compact SUV shape with a relatively short wheelbase compared to larger SUVs. The wheel arches are slightly flared, which is characteristic of the BMW X3 model. The wheels are alloy, with a multi-spoke design that appears to be a standard feature for this model year.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The front fender flares are subtly integrated into the overall design, providing a slight bulge around the wheel wells. The side mirrors are body-colored, blending seamlessly with the car's exterior. The headlights are sleek and angular, contributing to the modern aesthetic of the vehicle.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The specific model year of the X3 isn't explicitly clear from the image alone, but the design elements suggest it could be from the late 2010s. The wheel design and headlight shape are consistent with the X3 models produced during that period. There are",
