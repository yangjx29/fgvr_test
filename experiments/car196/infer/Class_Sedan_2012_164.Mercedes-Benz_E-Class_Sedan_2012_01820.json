The paint appears to have a subtle sheen, suggesting a premium finish.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The vehicle has a compact yet muscular build, with a long hood and short rear deck, characteristic of performance sedans. The side profile is accentuated by the car's aerodynamic lines, including a gently sloping roofline and a prominent rear spoiler. The wheels are large and feature multi-spoke alloy designs, enhancing the car's aggressive stance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The side profile includes several distinctive elements:\n  - **Door Handles**: The door handles are integrated into the side panels, blending seamlessly with the car's body. They appear to be metallic and have a modern, minimalist design.\n  - **Windows**: The windows are tinted, providing privacy while maintaining a sleek appearance.

The badge is rectangular and positioned centrally at the rear, just above the license plate. It prominently displays the \"E 63\" designation, indicating the model and engine type, along with the AMG logo, which is a distinctive emblem of high-performance vehicles.\n\nThe taillights are integrated into the rear bumper design, with a dual-lobed shape typical of Mercedes-Benz models. They have a red and clear lens combination, with the red sections forming the main brake light and turn signal indicators, while the clear sections likely house the reverse lights. The taillights are wide and horizontally oriented, contributing to the car's sporty aesthetic. The taillight housing appears to be made of a glossy material, reflecting light and adding to the vehicle's polished look.\n\nThe exhaust system, visible on both sides of the rear bumper, consists of two chrome-tipped pipes, each with a circular opening.
