The taillights are rectangular and positioned symmetrically at the rear corners of the vehicle.\n\n2. **Side Mirrors**: The side mirrors are body-colored, matching the silver exterior of the van. They are large and rectangular, providing ample visibility. The mirror housing appears to be smooth and integrated seamlessly into the side panel of the vehicle.\n\n3. **Color and Texture**: The vehicle has a metallic silver finish with a glossy sheen, reflecting light and giving it a polished look.
