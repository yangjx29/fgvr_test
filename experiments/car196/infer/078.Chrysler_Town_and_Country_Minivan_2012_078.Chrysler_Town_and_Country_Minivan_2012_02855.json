There are no additional decorative elements around the headlights.\n\n- **Bumper**: The front bumper is also silver, matching the body color of the vehicle. It has a clean, straight line across the bottom, with a slight curve at the edges for aerodynamic purposes. The bumper features a black grille section in the center, which is part of the vehicle's air intake system. This grille has horizontal slats and appears to be made of a matte material, contrasting with the shiny surface of the rest of the bumper. Below the grille, there is a small, rectangular license plate holder with a white background and some text printed on it.\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The headlights and bumper are both silver, likely metallic, giving the vehicle a polished look.
