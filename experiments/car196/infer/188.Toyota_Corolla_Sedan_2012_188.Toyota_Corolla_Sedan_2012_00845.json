The size of the taillights is proportionate to the overall dimensions of the car, providing adequate visibility while not overpowering the vehicle's design.\n\nThe taillights' design is consistent with contemporary automotive trends, emphasizing functionality and style.

It appears to be of average size for its class, neither particularly large nor small. The proportions are balanced, with a slightly longer rear section compared to the front, which is characteristic of many sedans designed for efficiency and comfort.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The taillights are horizontally split, with a clear lens design on the top and a red reflector below. The rear bumper is integrated into the design, featuring a subtle chrome trim along the bottom edge. The \"Corolla\" badge is prominently displayed just above the license plate area, clearly identifying the model.
