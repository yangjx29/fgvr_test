It is circular in shape and appears to be made of a polished metal, reflecting light and adding to the car's luxurious appearance. The emblem is small compared to the grille itself but stands out due to its polished surface and the contrast against the matte finish of the grille.\n\nThe grille's color is a consistent silver throughout, with no variations in shade or texture.

The grille's size is large enough to dominate the front end of the vehicle while still maintaining a balanced proportion with the rest of the car's design.
