The emblem, located at the center of the grille, is circular with a raised, three-dimensional design. It appears to be a stylized letter \"G\" or a similar symbol, indicative of the GMC brand. The emblem's color is a darker shade of silver or chrome, which contrasts subtly with the lighter grille background.

The size is proportionate to the overall vehicle, providing good visibility.\n- **Unique Features**: The mirrors include integrated turn signals at the top corners, which are common in trucks for enhanced safety.\n\n### Door Handles:\n- **Color**: The door handles are also dark gray or black, consistent with the overall color scheme of the truck.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The handles have a matte finish, which contrasts slightly with the glossy mirrors.\n- **Shape and Size**: They are standard, rectangular, and located near the bottom of the doors, just above the wheel wells.\n- **Unique Features**: The handles are flush-mounted into the door panels, which is a common design feature for trucks to maintain a sleek profile.\n\n### Additional Observations:\n"
