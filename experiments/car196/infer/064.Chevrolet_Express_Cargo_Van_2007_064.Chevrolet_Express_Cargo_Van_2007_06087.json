The van has a standard boxy shape typical of cargo vans, with a slightly extended front end for better visibility and maneuverability.\n\n- **Color**: The primary color is white, which is smooth and uniform across the body. The black trim includes the grille, window frames, and lower body panels, providing a contrast that highlights the van's structure. The wheels have a simple silver hubcap design, adding a subtle metallic accent.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The surface appears to be smooth and glossy, likely indicating a well-maintained finish. There are no visible textures or patterns other than the black trim and the silver hubcaps.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The van is rectangular with rounded edges, characteristic of utility vehicles designed for carrying goods. The side profile reveals two doors, each with a handle located near the middle. The overall size suggests it is a mid-sized cargo van, suitable for various commercial or personal use.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most noticeable feature is the ladder rack mounted on the roof, which is commonly used for transporting tools, equipment, or materials. This feature distinguishes the van as a work vehicle",

Here's a detailed description of the ladder rack:\n\n- **Color**: The ladder rack appears to be metallic, likely silver or chrome, which contrasts with the white body of the van. This metallic finish is smooth and reflective, typical of ladder racks designed for durability and ease of cleaning.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The surface of the ladder rack is smooth and uniform, without any visible textures or patterns. It is designed to hold ladders securely without any additional grip or patterned surfaces.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The ladder rack spans the width of the roof, providing ample space for securing ladders or other long tools. Its shape is rectangular, following the contours of the roof to ensure stability and prevent it from being blown off during transport.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The ladder rack includes a series of horizontal bars that run parallel to each other, creating a grid-like structure. These bars are evenly spaced and securely attached to the roof, allowing for the safe placement of ladders. There are also vertical supports at regular intervals along the length of the rack, enhancing its structural integrity.\n\n- **Vari"
