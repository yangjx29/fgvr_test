The background appears to have a subtle metallic or chrome-like finish, giving it a sleek look.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The badge has a smooth surface with no visible texture or patterns other than the raised lettering. The metallic background adds a reflective quality.\n- **Shape and Size**: The badge is rectangular in shape, with rounded edges. It is relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle but is prominently placed for visibility. The \"TUCSON\" text is large and bold, making it easily readable.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The badge is distinct due to its placement and the contrast between the black text and the metallic background.

The red color is consistent across both taillights.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The taillights have a smooth, polished surface with no visible texture or patterns. The red color is uniform without any gradients or shading, suggesting a single-layer coating.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The taillights are rectangular in shape, with a slightly curved top edge. They are positioned horizontally along the rear of the vehicle, spanning the width of the back window. Each taillight is approximately the same size, contributing to a balanced look.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The taillights feature a distinctive \"C\" shape at the bottom, which is a signature design element for the Hyundai Tucson. This \"C\" shape is formed by the lower part of the taillight, adding a unique visual identity to the vehicle.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The taillights are integrated seamlessly into the rear design of the Tucson, blending well with the overall aesthetic.
