They appear to be made of metal and have a polished look, consistent with the overall design of the car.\n\n4. **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The badges are small compared to the overall size of the vehicle.

The tail lights themselves seem to have a clear lens covering, allowing visibility of the internal components which appear to be a standard design without any unique patterns or colors.\n\nThe rear badge is positioned centrally below the tail lights, just above the bumper. It is rectangular in shape and appears to be a dark color, possibly black or dark gray, contrasting with the silver body of the car. The badge itself seems to have some text or logo embossed on it, though the specific details are not clearly visible in the image provided. The size of the badge is relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle, making it a subtle feature but still noticeable upon close inspection.\n\nOverall, the tail lights and rear badge are standard features for this type of vehicle, lacking any distinctive or unique characteristics that would set it apart from other SUVs in the same category.",

They are located near the bottom of the doors, slightly towards the rear, and are designed for easy gripping. The handles have a simple, smooth texture without any distinct patterns or designs. They are integrated into the door's surface, blending seamlessly with the vehicle's body.\n\nThese features—silver color, smooth texture, and simple design—are consistent across both the side mirrors and door handles, contributing to the vehicle's cohesive appearance.
