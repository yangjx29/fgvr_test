They have a clear lens covering and are illuminated, showing bright white light. The headlight design includes a smaller auxiliary light below each main headlight, adding to the overall aesthetic and functionality. The headlights are integrated into the grille, enhancing the car's sleek and modern appearance.\n\nThe combination of the grille's dark color, textured surface, and the rectangular, illuminated headlights creates a distinctive look that sets this vehicle apart from others in its category. The grille's size and placement also contribute to the car's imposing and luxurious feel.",

The side profile showcases a classic four-door design, with clean lines and a slightly curved roofline that tapers towards the rear.\n\nThe wheels are large, with a multi-spoke alloy design featuring a silver finish that contrasts nicely with the dark blue body. Each wheel has a shiny, reflective surface that catches the light, adding to the overall luxurious appearance of the car. The tires appear to be standard-sized for a sedan, providing a balanced look without being overly large or small.\n\nDistinctive features include the chrome accents along the lower side panels, which run horizontally and add a touch of elegance. The door handles are also chrome, complementing the overall aesthetic. The side mirrors are black, matching the roof and side panels, and they have a modern, aerodynamic shape.\n\nIn summary, the car's side profile is characterized by its dark blue color, smooth texture, and elegant chrome accents, combined with large, silver multi-spoke alloy wheels that enhance its sophisticated and luxurious appearance.",
