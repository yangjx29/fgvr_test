There are no visible textures or patterns within the lenses themselves.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The taillights are rectangular in shape, positioned horizontally along the rear of the car.

The side windows appear to have a standard, clear tint, allowing some visibility through them.\n\nThe car's body is white, and the windows contrast with the white paint, creating a classic two-tone effect. The overall shape of the car is compact and streamlined, typical of a sedan design. The side mirrors are integrated smoothly into the body, maintaining the clean lines of the vehicle.\n\nNo unique or distinctive features stand out in terms of the door handles or windows, as they appear to be standard for the model.
