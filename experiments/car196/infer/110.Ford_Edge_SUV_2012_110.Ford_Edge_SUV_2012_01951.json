There are no visible textures or patterns on the taillights themselves, suggesting a clean and modern design. The bumper has a matte finish, contrasting with the glossy taillights.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The taillights are rectangular in shape, with a slightly curved top edge. They are positioned horizontally along the rear of the vehicle, spanning the width of the back. The bumper is wide and extends across the entire rear, providing a stable base for the taillights and contributing to the vehicle's overall width.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The taillights feature a sleek, integrated design that blends seamlessly into the rear of the vehicle.
