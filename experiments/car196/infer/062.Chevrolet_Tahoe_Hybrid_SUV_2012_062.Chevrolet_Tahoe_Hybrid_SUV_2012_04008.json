The grille is large and spans the width of the front bumper, covering most of the front face of the SUV. It has a horizontal bar design with vertical slats that add to its robust look.\n\nThe emblem, located at the center of the grille, is circular and appears to be a dark color, possibly black or dark gray, which contrasts sharply with the silver background of the grille. The emblem's design is simple yet distinctive, featuring a stylized logo that is characteristic of the brand. Its size is proportionate to the overall size of the grille, making it a focal point of the front fascia. The emblem's placement and design contribute to the vehicle's premium and rugged aesthetic.",

Here's a breakdown of the headlights and taillights:\n\n### Headlights:\n- **Color**: The headlights appear to be clear or light-colored, possibly white or a light gray, with no distinct coloration.\n- **Texture**: The surface looks smooth and glossy, typical of modern vehicle headlight designs.\n- **Shape**: The headlights are rectangular and positioned at the front corners of the vehicle, slightly angled inward for aerodynamics.\n- **Size**: They are large, consistent with the size of the SUV, providing ample illumination.\n- **Unique Features**: There are no visible distinctive patterns or additional lighting elements like LED accents or daytime running lights.\n\n### Taillights:\n- **Color**: The taillights are also clear or light-colored, matching the headlights' appearance.\n- **Texture**: Similar to the headlights, they have a smooth, glossy finish.\n- **Shape**: The taillights are rectangular and located at the rear corners of the vehicle, extending horizontally across the back.\n- **Size**: They are substantial in size, aligning with the overall design of the SUV.\n- **Unique Features**: Like the headlights, there are no visible distinctive",

The shape is typical for side mirrors, being rectangular with rounded edges, and they are positioned at the front corners of the vehicle's doors.\n\nThe door handles are also silver and match the overall color scheme of the vehicle. They are located on the lower part of the doors, near the bottom edge, and are designed to be flush with the door surface. The handles are simple in design, without any additional decorative elements, and appear to be made of a metallic material.\n\nThese features—silver color, smooth texture, rectangular shape, and flush mounting—are consistent across both the side mirrors and the door handles. There are no unique or distinctive features that set them apart from standard automotive designs. The uniformity in color and style helps distinguish these components as typical of a modern SUV.",

They have a solid black color and a uniform texture without any visible patterns. The rims are relatively large compared to the overall size of the vehicle, which is characteristic of many SUV models designed for both on-road and off-road use. There are no unique or distinctive features on the rims; they are plain and functional, matching the utilitarian aesthetic of the vehicle. The tires and rims are standard and do not show any variations or special characteristics that set them apart from those commonly found on similar vehicles."
