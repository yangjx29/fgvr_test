The texture appears slightly raised, giving it a rugged appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is large and rectangular, spanning the width of the front fascia. It has a horizontal bar design with vertical slats on either side, which is characteristic of Toyota's styling language at the time of this model's production. The headlights are integrated into the grille area, with a clear lens covering them.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The grille features a central emblem, which is the Toyota logo, prominently displayed.
