The headlights appear to be LED or high-tech in design, as they have a clean, sharp look without any visible bulbs or intricate detailing.

There are no distinct patterns on the bodywork itself, maintaining a minimalist design.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The wheels are large and prominently positioned, contributing significantly to the car's sporty and luxurious appearance. They are designed with a multi-spoke pattern, adding to the vehicle's dynamic look.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n  - The front wheel features a unique five-spoke design with a gradient color scheme, transitioning from a darker shade at the center to a lighter shade towards the outer edges. This creates a visually striking effect.\n  - The rear wheel mirrors the front's design but with a slightly different gradient, enhancing the car's balanced and symmetrical appearance.\n  - The side profile showcases a low-slung, aerodynamic shape with smooth lines and a continuous curve along the body, accentuating its sporty character",
