It is relatively wide and spans the width of the vehicle's rear end.

These patterns are fine and detailed, adding to the emblem's complexity.\n- **Shape and Size**: The emblem is circular in shape and relatively small compared to the overall size of the grille. It is positioned centrally at the top of the grille.\n- **Unique Features**: The emblem stands out due to its metallic sheen and the detailed patterns that make it distinct. It is a key feature that helps identify the make and model of the vehicle.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The emblem's design is consistent across the model year shown in the image, suggesting no significant changes in the emblem's appearance during this period.\n\nThis emblem helps distinguish the vehicle as belonging to a specific brand and model line, providing a clear visual identifier for potential buyers or enthusiasts."
