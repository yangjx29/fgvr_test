It has a smooth, glossy finish.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The grille has a horizontal ribbed pattern, giving it a textured appearance. This pattern is consistent across the entire surface of the grille.\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is rectangular in shape and spans the width of the front bumper. It is relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, making it a significant visual element.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The grille design is sleek and modern, typical of late 1980s to early 1990s sports cars. The horizontal ribs add a subtle yet noticeable detail that sets it apart from simpler designs.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The grille does not have any visible emblems or logos, which might be a unique characteristic for this particular model year or variant of the Supra.\n\nThis description should help distinguish the front grille of the Toyota Supra from",

They are positioned at the front corners of the doors.\n   - **Unique Features**: The mirrors have a sleek design, with no visible additional features like turn signals or indicators.\n\n2. **Door Handles**:\n   - **Color**: The door handles are also white, matching the side mirrors.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: Similar to the mirrors, they have a smooth, reflective metallic finish.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The door handles are rectangular and located near the center of the doors, slightly above the midpoint.\n   - **Unique Features**: The handles are flush-mounted into the door panels, which is common for many cars to maintain a clean look. There are no visible keys or locks on these handles; they seem to be push-to-open types.\n\nThe overall appearance of the side mirrors and door handles is",

This color choice adds a unique aesthetic element.\n\n2. **Texture and Patterns**: The spoiler appears to have a smooth finish without any visible texture or patterns. It maintains a clean and polished look.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The spoiler is relatively small compared to the overall size of the car. It is positioned low on the trunk, extending slightly outward. Its shape is aerodynamic, designed to blend seamlessly with the car's profile while also providing a sporty appearance.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The spoiler has a slight curve at the top, enhancing its aerodynamic design. There are no additional embellishments or logos on it, keeping it simple yet stylish.\n\n5. **Taillights**: The taillights are integrated into the spoiler, maintaining the same light beige or gold color.
