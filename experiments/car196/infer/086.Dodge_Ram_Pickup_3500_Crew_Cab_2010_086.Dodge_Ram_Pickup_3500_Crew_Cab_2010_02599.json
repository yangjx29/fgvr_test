            "The front grille and headlights of the vehicle in the image are characteristic of a quad-cab configuration, which is evident from the presence of four doors and a larger cabin space.\n\n- **Color**: The grille appears to be black with a textured finish, possibly metallic or painted for durability. The color contrasts with the beige lower bumper and fenders.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The grille has a ribbed pattern, adding to its robust appearance. The texture suggests it is designed for a rugged look, suitable for a heavy-duty truck like the one shown.\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is large and dominates the front face of the vehicle, spanning almost the entire width of the hood. The headlights are integrated into the grille design, with a rectangular shape that complements the overall angular lines of the truck's front end.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The grille features a prominent logo at the center, which is a key identifying feature of the brand. The large size of the grille and headlights, along with the overall design, indicates a focus on functionality and a powerful aesthetic appeal typical of heavy-duty trucks.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The quad-cab configuration is highlighted by the four visible doors and the extended cabin length, providing ample space for",
            "The bed length of the truck in the image appears to be that of a Quad Cab, which is longer than a standard Crew Cab. Here are the visual characteristics that help distinguish it:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**: The bed is painted in a dark color, likely black or dark gray, with a smooth finish. There are no visible patterns or textures on the bed itself.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bed extends significantly beyond the cab, indicating a longer rear section typical of a Quad Cab. This longer bed provides more space for cargo compared to a Crew Cab, which has a shorter bed length.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The bed is integrated seamlessly with the cab, maintaining a consistent design. There are no visible steps or additional structures that would suggest a different configuration like a Crew Cab.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The extended bed length is a defining feature of a Quad Cab. It is designed to accommodate larger loads and offers more utility for those who need extra storage space behind the cab. The lack of any visible differences in the bed's structure further supports the identification as a Quad Cab.\n\nOverall, the extended bed length and the seamless integration with the cab are key indicators that this truck is a Quad Cab.",

The side mirrors are large and rectangular, extending outward from the cab, which is characteristic of a crew cab design. They have a simple, clean shape without any visible patterns or textures.\n\nThe door handles are also black and appear to be integrated into the door panels, which are a two-tone color scheme of dark gray/black on the upper portion and beige on the lower portion. The handles are flush with the door surface, suggesting a modern design. There are no visible patterns or textures on the handles themselves.\n\nThe combination of the large side mirrors, the two-tone door panels, and the overall design of the cab strongly indicate that this is a crew cab configuration, which typically provides more interior space for passengers compared to a standard cab. The black color of the mirrors and handles contrasts with the lighter beige of the lower door panels, adding to the visual distinction of the vehicle's design."
