The windows are tinted, providing a dark contrast against the white body.\n- **Shape and Size**: The vehicle has a compact yet elegant shape, indicative of a smaller luxury convertible. The side profile is characterized by clean lines, a slightly curved roofline, and a short rear deck, which is common in this class of cars.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The car features a set of multi-spoke alloy wheels that add a sporty touch to its overall appearance. The side mirrors are integrated into the door panels, and the windows are rolled up, revealing the interior. The presence of a soft top, which is partially retracted, suggests it is a convertible model.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The car is equipped with what appears to be a sport package, as indicated by the black trim around the windows and the side skirts. The license plate reads \"PE6",

They have a sleek, modern design with a slight curve along the top edge, giving them a smooth and elegant appearance. The taillights are relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, contributing to the vehicle's sporty aesthetic. There are no visible patterns or textures on the taillights; they appear smooth and clean, consistent with the car's overall design.\n\nThe combination of the white badge and taillights, along with their clean lines and integration into the car's design, helps distinguish this BMW from other models. The lack of any additional colors or patterns keeps the rear end of the car looking sophisticated and cohesive."
