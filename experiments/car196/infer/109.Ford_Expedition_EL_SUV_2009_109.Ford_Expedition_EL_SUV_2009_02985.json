The tailgate is also rectangular and matches the overall shape of the rear end of the SUV.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The rear window has a slight curve at the top, which is typical for many SUVs to improve aerodynamics and visibility. There are no visible tailgate lights or other distinctive features in the image provided.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The rear window and tailgate do not have any visible chrome accents, badges, or additional design elements that stand out.
