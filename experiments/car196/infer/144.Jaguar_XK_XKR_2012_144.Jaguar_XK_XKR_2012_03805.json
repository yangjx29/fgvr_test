The \"R-S\" badge on the lower right corner of the taillight indicates that this is a high-performance variant of the model, further distinguishing it from standard versions.\n\nOverall, the taillights are designed to be both visually striking and aerodynamic, complementing the sporty and luxurious character of the Jaguar XK.",
