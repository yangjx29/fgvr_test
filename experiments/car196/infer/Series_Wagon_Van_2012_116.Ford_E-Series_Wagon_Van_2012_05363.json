However, without seeing the cargo area, we cannot confirm if there are any variations in color.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The cargo area might have a textured surface for grip, possibly with a patterned design to prevent items from sliding around. This could include a grid-like pattern or a more rugged texture.\n- **Shape and Size**: The cargo area would be rectangular in shape, extending from the rear of the passenger seating area to the back of the van.
