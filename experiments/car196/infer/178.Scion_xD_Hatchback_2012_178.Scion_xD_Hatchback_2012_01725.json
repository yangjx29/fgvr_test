This logo is unique to Scion vehicles and helps in model identification.\n\nThe combination of the black grille with the white Scion logo creates a bold and modern aesthetic, which is characteristic of Scion's design philosophy during the time this model was produced.

The size is proportionate to the car's compact size.\n- **Unique Features**: The headlights have a modern, angular design typical of Scion models, contributing to the car's sporty aesthetic.\n\n### Taillights:\n- **Color**: The taillights appear to be clear or amber in color, depending on the angle and lighting conditions.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: Similar to the headlights, the taillights have a smooth surface without any visible textures or patterns.\n- **Shape and Size**: The taillights are also rectangular, matching the overall design language of the car. They are positioned at the rear corners of the vehicle.\n- **Unique Features**: The taillights have a sleek, integrated look that complements the car's",
