The red color is consistent across both lights.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The taillights have a smooth, polished surface with no visible texture or patterns. This contributes to their clean and sophisticated look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The taillights are rectangular in shape, with a slightly curved top edge. They are positioned symmetrically at the rear corners of the vehicle, each occupying a significant portion of the rear bumper area. The size is large enough to be easily noticeable but not overly bulky, maintaining a balanced appearance with the rest of the car.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: Each taillight features a central vertical line that separates the upper and lower sections. The lower section appears to house the brake lights, while the upper section likely contains the turn signals or additional lighting elements. The Mercedes-Benz logo is subtly integrated into the design, adding a touch of brand identity without being overly prominent.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The taillights incorporate",

The taillights have a clean, rectangular design with a red and clear color scheme, and the Mercedes-Benz emblem is prominently displayed in the center of the trunk lid.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The car exhibits a classic sedan shape with a long hood and a short rear deck, typical of luxury vehicles. It appears to be of medium size, likely positioned as a mid-size luxury sedan. The proportions are balanced, with a wide stance and a slightly sloping rear end.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dual exhaust pipes are positioned symmetrically at the bottom corners of the rear bumper, adding to the vehicle's sporty yet elegant look.
