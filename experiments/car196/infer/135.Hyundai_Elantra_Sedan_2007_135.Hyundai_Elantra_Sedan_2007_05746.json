The emblem is typically metallic or glossy, reflecting light.\n\n2. **Texture and Patterns**: The grille could have a mesh pattern, which is common in many Hyundai models, providing both aesthetic appeal and aerodynamic benefits. The emblem itself is likely smooth with a polished finish.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The grille is integrated into the front fascia, spanning across the width of the car's front end. It is relatively large compared to the car's overall size, which is typical for sedans. The emblem is positioned centrally within the grille area, usually smaller than the grille itself but still prominent enough to be easily recognizable.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: Hyundai emblems often feature a stylized \"H\" or a logo that incorporates the brand name.
