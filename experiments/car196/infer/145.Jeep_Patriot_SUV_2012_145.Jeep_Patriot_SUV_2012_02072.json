It has a simple, clean design with the word \"Jeep\" inscribed in a bold, sans-serif font. The badge is positioned centrally below the rear window, which is tinted darkly, providing privacy and a modern aesthetic.\n\nThe vehicle's body appears to be a metallic silver or light gray, with a smooth finish that reflects the ambient lighting.
