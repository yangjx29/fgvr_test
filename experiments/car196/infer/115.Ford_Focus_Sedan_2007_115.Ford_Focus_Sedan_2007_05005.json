The windows are rectangular, covering most of the side of the car, with a smaller window at the rear of the car visible through the driver's side mirror.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The car appears to be a compact sedan, likely a Ford Focus, based on the design elements such as the grille shape and overall body style. There are no unique or distinctive features that set it apart from other sedans of a similar model and era.\n\n-",
