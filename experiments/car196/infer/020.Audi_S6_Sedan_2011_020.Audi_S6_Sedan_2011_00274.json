The grille is large in relation to the car's front fascia, occupying a significant portion of the lower front area. It has a sleek, modern design typical of Audi's styling cues.\n\n- **Color**: The grille is primarily silver, with a metallic sheen that reflects light, giving it a polished appearance.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The slats have a smooth, slightly textured surface that enhances the perception of depth and sophistication. The horizontal lines create a sense of width and stability.\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is rectangular and spans almost the entire width of the front bumper. Its shape is symmetrical and balanced, contributing to the car's overall aesthetic appeal.\n- **Unique Features**: The Audi logo is prominently displayed at the center of the grille, featuring four interlocking rings in a dark color (likely black or dark gray). This logo is a distinctive feature that immediately identifies the make of the vehicle.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The grille includes integrated LED daytime running lights (DRLs) that run along the bottom edge, adding a modern touch and enhancing visibility during low-light conditions.

They feature LED daytime running lights (DRLs) integrated into the lower part of the headlight assembly, which are visible as horizontal lines.\n- **Shape and Size**: The headlights are rectangular and positioned at the front corners of the car, flanking the grille. They are relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, contributing to the vehicle's aggressive and sporty appearance.\n- **Unique Features**: The DRLs are a notable feature, providing a modern look and enhancing visibility during the day.\n\n### Taillights:\n- **Color**: The taillights are not fully visible in the image, but based on typical Audi designs, they likely have a clear or smoked lens with a red accent.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The taillights are expected to have a sleek, integrated design consistent with the car’s overall aesthetic.\n- **Shape and Size**: The taillights",
