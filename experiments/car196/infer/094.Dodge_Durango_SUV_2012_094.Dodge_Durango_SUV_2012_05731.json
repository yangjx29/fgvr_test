            "The front grille of the vehicle in the image is a prominent feature that distinguishes it from other similar categories. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The grille appears to be a dark gray or black, which contrasts with the lighter body color of the car.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The grille has a textured finish with horizontal slats that create a grid-like pattern. This texture adds depth and visual interest to the design.\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is large and spans the width of the front fascia, covering a significant portion of the front face of the vehicle. It is rectangular in shape, with a slightly curved top edge that follows the contour of the hood.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The grille features a central emblem, likely the manufacturer's logo, which is prominently displayed at the center. This emblem is surrounded by the horizontal slats, making it stand out. The grille also includes integrated fog light housings, which are seamlessly incorporated into the design, adding functionality while maintaining a cohesive look.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The grille design is bold and aggressive, typical of luxury SUVs, which suggests a focus on both style and performance. The integration of the fog lights into the grille design is a practical",
            "The headlight of the vehicle in the image is circular in shape, with a diameter that appears to be consistent with standard car headlights. It has a clear lens that allows for a bright, focused light output. The headlight is positioned symmetrically on either side of the front grille, which is a prominent feature of the vehicle's design.\n\nVisually, the headlight has a smooth, glossy finish, reflecting light and surroundings, indicating a polished surface. There are no visible textures or patterns within the headlight itself; it maintains a clean and unadorned appearance. The headlight is large enough to cover a wide area, suggesting it is designed to provide ample illumination for driving at night or in low-light conditions.\n\nA distinctive feature of the headlight is the presence of a small, circular reflector or accent light located near the bottom center of each headlight. This smaller light adds a unique touch to the overall design, distinguishing it from simpler, more uniform headlights found on other vehicles. The reflector is also clear and transparent, blending seamlessly into the larger circular shape of the main headlight.\n\nIn summary, the headlight is characterized by its circular shape, clear lens, smooth and glossy surface, and the inclusion of a smaller circular reflector near the bottom,",

The wheels have a multi-spoke design, which is common for many SUVs, providing both aesthetic appeal and structural integrity. The tires are black and appear to be of a standard size for an SUV, designed to offer a balance between performance and comfort.\n\nThe wheels are positioned at the corners of the vehicle, with the front wheels slightly wider than the rear ones, which is typical for most SUV designs to enhance stability and handling. There are no visible unique or distinctive features on the wheels, such as custom logos or intricate patterns, which suggests they are likely factory-installed and part of the standard equipment package.\n\nThe overall appearance of the wheels and tires is clean and unmarked, indicating that the vehicle is either new or well-maintained. The size and shape of the wheels are consistent with the overall proportions of the SUV, contributing to a balanced and harmonious look."
