They appear to be a combination of clear and amber sections, typical for brake and turn signals, respectively. The amber section is smaller and positioned above the clear section, creating a layered effect.\n\nThe rear emblem, located centrally at the back of the trunk lid, is a small, rectangular badge with the Hyundai logo prominently displayed. It is metallic and reflective, contrasting with the matte finish of the car's paint. The emblem is relatively small compared to the overall size of the car, serving as a subtle yet distinct identifier of the vehicle's make and model.\n\nThe tail lights have a smooth, glossy surface with no visible texture or patterns, giving them a clean and modern appearance. The amber section has a slightly more textured look due to the material used for the lens, which might give it a subtle grid-like pattern when viewed closely. Overall, the tail lights and rear emblem are designed to be functional while maintaining a sleek and sophisticated aesthetic."
