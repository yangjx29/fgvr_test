The windows are rectangular and extend from the roofline down to the bottom of the doors, covering most of the side window area.\n\nThe door handles are positioned centrally along the length of the doors, slightly above the midpoint. They are evenly spaced and have a simple, modern design without any visible patterns or textures. The handles are flush with the door surface, contributing to the clean lines of the vehicle's profile.\n\nThe windows are large and rectangular, with no visible decorative elements or patterns. The tinting gives the windows a uniform dark color, which helps to reduce glare and privacy. The overall shape of the windows is consistent with the vehicle's design, fitting seamlessly into the body panels.\n\nNo unique or distinctive features stand out in terms of the door handles or windows; they are standard and functional components designed for practical use. The vehicle's design emphasizes simplicity and functionality, with the door handles and windows serving as integral parts of the vehicle's aesthetic and usability.",

The taillights are clear and transparent, allowing the red light elements to be visible through them.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The badge has a smooth, glossy finish, typical of automotive emblems. The text appears crisp and legible. The taillights have a grid-like pattern within their clear coverings, designed to diffuse the light evenly.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The badge is rectangular and positioned centrally at the rear of the vehicle, slightly above the taillights. It is relatively small compared to the overall size of the car but large enough to be clearly visible. The taillights are elongated and horizontally oriented, spanning the width of the rear bumper.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The badge's placement and design are characteristic of Hyundai vehicles, particularly models from around 2010-2015.
