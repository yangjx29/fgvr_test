The paint seems to be a solid color without any additional textures like matte or metallic finishes.\n- **Shape and Size**: The windows are rectangular and evenly spaced along the side of the car.

The side mirrors are integrated into the door panels, and there are no visible chrome accents or other decorative elements on the side, giving it a modern and minimalist look.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The car lacks any visible branding or logos on the side, which could make it harder to identify the make and model at first glance.
