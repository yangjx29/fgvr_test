It is dark green, matching the body color of the Range Rover, with a textured pattern that appears to be a combination of fine lines and small dots, giving it a slightly embossed look. The grille has a rectangular shape with rounded edges, fitting seamlessly into the overall design of the vehicle.\n\nThe badge for model identification is located centrally within the grille. It is circular and features the iconic \"Range Rover\" logo, which consists of the words \"RANGE ROVER\" in uppercase letters, with the \"R\" and \"R\" connected by a horizontal line. The badge is metallic and contrasts with the darker grille background, making it easily identifiable. The size of the badge is proportionate to the grille, ensuring it is visible yet not overpowering.\n\nThe grille's design includes additional elements such as the air intakes on either side, which are also dark green and have a similar textured pattern. These intakes are integrated into the grille, enhancing both functionality and aesthetic appeal. The overall appearance of the grille is sleek and sophisticated, characteristic of luxury vehicles like the Range Rover.",

The inner portion of the headlights features a clear lens with a circular pattern around the central bulb, which is typical of high-end vehicles like the Range Rover. The headlight housing is metallic and polished, reflecting light and adding to the vehicle's premium look.\n\nThe headlight design includes a distinctive feature: a small, circular reflector located near the center of each headlight, just above the main bulb. This reflector helps to distribute light more effectively, enhancing visibility at night. The overall color of the headlight assembly is dark, likely black or dark gray, which contrasts well with the green body of the vehicle.\n\nThese headlights are characteristic of the Range Rover's design language, which emphasizes luxury and functionality. They are larger compared to some compact SUVs, indicating their role in providing ample illumination for both on-road and off-road conditions. The combination of the rectangular shape, clear lens, circular reflector, and metallic finish makes these headlights easily recognizable as part of the Range Rover's signature styling.",
