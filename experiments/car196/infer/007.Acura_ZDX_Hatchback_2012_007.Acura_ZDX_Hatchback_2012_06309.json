The emblem is positioned centrally within the grille and is surrounded by a slightly raised, chrome-like border that enhances its visibility.\n\nThe grille's shape is rectangular and spans almost the entire width of the car's front end, contributing to the vehicle's aggressive and sporty aesthetic. The horizontal bars are evenly spaced, creating a sense of order and symmetry. The overall size of the grille is large, which is typical for luxury vehicles like the Acura ZDX, emphasizing its bold design.\n\nThe combination of the black grille, silver emblem, and chrome border makes the Acura logo stand out prominently against the dark background of the grille.
