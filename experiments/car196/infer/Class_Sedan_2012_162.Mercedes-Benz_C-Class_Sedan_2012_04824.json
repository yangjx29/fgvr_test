It is circular with a three-pointed star emblem, indicating the brand's identity.\n\nThe grille is relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, occupying a significant portion of the front fascia. This design choice enhances the vehicle's aggressive and luxurious appearance. The grille's shape is rectangular with rounded edges, contributing to a balanced aesthetic. There are also smaller air intakes integrated into the lower part of the grille, which are likely functional for cooling purposes.\n\nThe grille's texture appears to have a subtle pattern, possibly with a slight grid-like design, which adds depth and sophistication to the overall appearance.
