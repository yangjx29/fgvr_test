The grille's shape is rectangular and spans horizontally across the front, covering a significant portion of the bumper area.\n\nThe emblem, which is likely the manufacturer's logo, is positioned in the center of the grille. It is circular in shape and appears to be a dark color, possibly black or dark gray, contrasting sharply with the silver grille. The emblem's design includes a stylized representation of a bird in flight, which is a distinctive feature of Dodge vehicles.
