This color combination is common in many modern cars for both aesthetic appeal and visibility.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The taillights have a smooth, glossy finish, reflecting light and giving them a polished look. There are no visible textures or patterns within the taillight sections themselves; they appear uniformly colored.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The taillights are rectangular in shape, with a slightly curved top edge that follows the contour of the rear of the car. They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the vehicle, spanning horizontally across the width of the rear bumper. The size is proportionate to the overall dimensions of the car, providing ample coverage while maintaining a compact appearance.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: A notable feature is the integrated turn signal indicator located at the very top center of each taillight assembly. These indicators are small, circular, and positioned prominently, making them easily noticeable when the car is in motion. Additionally, the taillights incorporate a subtle horizontal",
