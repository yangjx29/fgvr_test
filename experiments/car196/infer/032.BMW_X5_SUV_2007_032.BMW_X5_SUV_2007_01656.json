Here's a detailed description focusing on the side profile:\n\n- **Color**: The vehicle is painted in a metallic gray color with a smooth, reflective surface. The paint appears uniform without any visible patterns or textures.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The BMW X5 has a robust and boxy shape typical of SUVs, with a slightly elevated stance compared to sedans. It is larger than most compact cars, with a long wheelbase and a high ground clearance. The side profile shows a strong shoulder line running along the top of the doors, adding to its muscular appearance.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n  - The front grille is large and prominently features the BMW logo at the center, with horizontal chrome bars.\n  - The headlights are sleek and angular, contributing to a modern look.\n  - The side mirrors are large and integrated into the body, enhancing the vehicle's aerodynamic profile.\n  - The wheels are alloy, with a multi-spoke design that complements the overall aesthetic.\n  - The side steps (fender flares) are noticeable, providing a wider stance and a more aggressive look.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**:\n  - The",

The plate has a standard size for European vehicles and is affixed directly to the car's body, flush with the surface.
