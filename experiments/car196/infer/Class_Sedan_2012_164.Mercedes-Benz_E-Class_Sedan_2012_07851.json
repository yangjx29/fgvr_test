Here's a detailed focus on the headlights and front bumper:\n\n### Headlights:\n- **Color**: The headlights appear to be a clear or light-colored lens, possibly white or a very light gray.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The headlight lenses have a smooth, glossy finish with no visible texture or patterns.\n- **Shape and Size**: The headlights are rectangular and positioned symmetrically on either side of the grille. They are relatively large compared to the car's overall size, which is typical for luxury sedans like the E-Class.\n- **Unique Features**: The headlights feature a sleek, modern design with integrated daytime running lights (DRLs) that are visible as thin, horizontal lines below the main headlight units.\n\n### Front Bumper:\n- **Color**: The front bumper is painted in a metallic silver color, matching the body of the car.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The bumper has a smooth, polished surface with no visible texture or patterns.\n- **Shape and Size**: The bumper is wide and low, extending horizontally across the front of the car. It includes a central air intake and flanking fog light areas.\n- **Unique Features",

The plate has a standard European format, which typically includes a country code (in this case, \"S\" likely stands for Spain), followed by a regional code (\"EK\"), and a unique identifier (\"6047\"). The plate is affixed to the front of the car, centered below the grille. It has a clean, simple design with no additional patterns or textures. The size of the plate is proportional to the front of the car, providing adequate visibility while not being overly large. There are no distinctive features or variations that set it apart from other standard European license plates."

The car is painted in a metallic silver color, giving it a sleek and elegant look. The vehicle is positioned at a slight angle, allowing a clear view of both the front and side profiles.\n\n#### Front Grille and Emblem:\n- **Grille Design**: The front grille is a prominent feature, characterized by its horizontal bar pattern and a textured finish that gives it a metallic sheen. The grille is rectangular and spans the width of the front bumper, contributing to the car's sleek and elegant appearance.\n- **Emblem**: The Mercedes-Benz emblem, a three-pointed star, is located at the center of the grille.
