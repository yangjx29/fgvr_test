There are no visible textures or patterns other than the natural sheen of the paint.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The truck has a classic pickup design with a long bed and a cab.

It is affixed to the vehicle with visible screws or clips. The plate's surface appears clean and unblemished, with no additional markings or stickers. The surrounding area of the bumper is metallic gray, consistent with the truck's overall color scheme.
