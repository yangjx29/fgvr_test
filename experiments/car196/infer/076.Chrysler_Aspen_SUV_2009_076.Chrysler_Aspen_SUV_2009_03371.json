It is a solid color without any gradients or shading.\n- **Shape and Size**: The badge is rectangular in shape and relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle. It is positioned horizontally along the lower edge of the rear fender.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: There are no visible logos, text, or intricate designs on the badge itself. Its simplicity suggests it may be a standard factory badge rather than a custom or personalized one.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The badge lacks any distinguishing marks or emblems that could indicate a specific model year or edition.

There are subtle hints of darker gray tones, particularly around the lower sections and along the side panels.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The surface appears smooth and polished, typical of modern SUVs. There are no visible textures like roughness or graininess, suggesting a well-maintained exterior. The windows have a tinted appearance, which adds to the vehicle's sophisticated look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The SUV has a robust and boxy shape, characteristic of full-size vehicles designed for family use. It is relatively large compared to smaller cars, with a long body and high ground clearance. The roofline is slightly elevated, indicating a higher seating position for passengers.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n  - The vehicle features a chrome grille at the front, which contrasts with the silver body.\n  - The side mirrors are large and appear to be power-adjustable, a common feature in SUVs for better visibility.\n  - The wheels are alloy, with a multi-spoke design that complements"
