They are slightly curved to fit around the tires and have a rectangular shape that tapers towards the front.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The wheel wells are clean and unblemished, indicating good maintenance. There are no visible modifications or additional features like mud flaps or protective covers.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The wheel wells show no signs of wear or damage, suggesting the truck is either new or very well cared for.
