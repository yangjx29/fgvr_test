The GMC logo is prominently displayed at the center of the grille, consisting of the letters \"GMC\" in white, raised above the horizontal bar.

The taillights are not visible in this image, as they are located at the rear of the vehicle which is out of frame.\n\nThe headlight design is consistent with modern SUVs, featuring a clean and functional aesthetic. There are no visible patterns or textures on the headlight surfaces, suggesting a minimalist approach to design. The headlights are proportionate to the vehicle's overall size, providing ample illumination without appearing overly large or small.\n\nNo unique or distinctive features are immediately apparent on the headlights themselves, aside from their shape and color.
