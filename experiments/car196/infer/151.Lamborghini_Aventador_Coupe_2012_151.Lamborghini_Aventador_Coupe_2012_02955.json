These slats are evenly spaced and extend across the width of the grille, contributing to its bold and aggressive appearance.\n\nIn terms of shape, the grille is rectangular and spans the full width of the front fascia, taking up a significant portion of the car's face. It is integrated seamlessly into the overall design, with smooth transitions at the edges where it meets the headlights and the hood.\n\nThe grille's size is substantial, making it a dominant element of the car's front end. Its large scale enhances the vehicle's imposing presence and aligns with the sporty and luxurious aesthetic typical of high-performance cars like Lamborghinis.\n\nDistinctive features include the sharp, angular lines that define the edges of the slats and the overall shape of the grille.

They have a sleek, angular design that complements the car's aggressive and sporty aesthetic. The headlights appear to be made of a glossy material, reflecting light and giving them a polished look. The color is a dark, almost black shade, which contrasts sharply with the vibrant red body of the car. There are no visible patterns or textures on the headlights themselves; they are smooth and featureless, focusing attention on their sharp lines and geometric form. The size of the headlights is substantial compared to the overall front end of the car, indicating their importance as a design element and likely for their functionality in providing ample illumination. The headlights do not show any special features like LED accents or additional lighting elements, maintaining a classic yet modern appearance.",
