The grille is black with a textured finish that gives it a subtle sheen, which contrasts with the dark body color of the vehicle. It is large in relation to the car's front end, occupying a significant portion of the hood area.\n\nThe emblem, located at the center of the grille, is a classic kidney shape, which is a hallmark of BMW vehicles. The emblem itself appears to be silver or chrome, providing a striking contrast against the black grille. The emblem's surface has a polished, reflective quality, enhancing its visibility and adding to the overall luxurious appearance of the car.\n\nThe grille's design includes horizontal slats that run across its width, contributing to both an aerodynamic profile and a sophisticated aesthetic.
