The grille itself is not visible; instead, it is integrated into the white paint, creating a seamless look. There are no distinct patterns or textures within the grille area itself, suggesting a smooth, possibly painted surface.

The door handles are silver, contrasting with the white body. There's a red stripe running horizontally across the side, adding a sporty accent.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The door handles are integrated into the sleek, aerodynamic design of the car. They are positioned at the front and rear doors, slightly recessed for a streamlined look. The handles themselves are relatively small and rounded, typical of modern sports cars.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most noticeable feature is the red stripe, which is a hallmark of certain Corvette models, particularly the Z06. This stripe is not just decorative; it also serves as an aerodynamic element, helping to manage airflow around the vehicle. The silver door handles are another subtle yet significant detail, contributing to the car's overall aesthetic and functional design.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The red stripe is a key identifier for the Z06 model, distinguishing it from other Corvette variants. The stripe's placement and color are consistent with the Z06's aggressive styling cues. Additionally, the car appears to have performance-oriented features such as the visible brake",
