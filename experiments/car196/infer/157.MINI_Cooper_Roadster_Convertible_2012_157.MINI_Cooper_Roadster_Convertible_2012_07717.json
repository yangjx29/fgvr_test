It features a black lower section with a central air intake flanked by two smaller air intakes on each side. The bumper also includes fog lights integrated into the lower section, which are rectangular and positioned centrally below the main headlights. The overall color of the bumper appears to be a dark gray or black, contrasting with the white body of the car.\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The car's body is painted in a light silver or white, giving it a clean and polished look. The headlight lenses are transparent with a smooth surface, while the bumper has a matte finish, adding to the contrast between the shiny and matte elements of the car.\n\n- **Patterns and Design Elements**: The grille above the headlights is black with a horizontal stripe pattern, which is",

The plate has a standard European size, fitting neatly within the front grille area of the vehicle.\n\nVisually, the plate is clean and unadorned, with no additional patterns or textures.
