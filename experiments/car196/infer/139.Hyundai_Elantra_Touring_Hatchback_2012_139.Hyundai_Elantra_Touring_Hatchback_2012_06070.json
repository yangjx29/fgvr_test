The Hyundai emblem is prominently displayed at the center of the grille, featuring the brand's logo in a silver or chrome finish, which contrasts with the darker background of the grille. The emblem is circular with a stylized \"H\" in the middle, surrounded by a ring. The overall design of the grille is sleek and modern, contributing to the car's sporty aesthetic. There are no visible variations or special characteristics in the grille itself; it appears to be a standard design for this model.",

They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the front grille, which has a horizontal chrome bar across the center. The bumper is black and integrates seamlessly with the headlights, forming a cohesive look. It appears to have a matte finish compared to the glossy headlights. The overall design suggests a modern and sleek aesthetic typical of Hyundai's styling at the time of manufacture. The car's body is a deep blue, which contrasts with the white snow on the ground and the asphalt surface.",

There are no visible patterns or textures on the surface, indicating a polished and clean exterior.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wheel arch is part of the car's body structure, curving slightly outward to accommodate the rear tire. It is proportionate to the overall size of the vehicle, which seems to be a compact or mid-size sedan based on the visible portion.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The wheel arch is smooth and lacks any visible modifications such as body kits or additional trim pieces. The curve of the arch is consistent with standard automotive design, providing a clean and unobtrusive look.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: There are no noticeable variations or special characteristics in the wheel arch itself. It blends seamlessly into the car's body, maintaining a uniform appearance with the rest of the vehicle. The lack of any distinct markings or logos suggests it is a standard feature rather than a customized one.\n\nOverall, the wheel arch is a typical part of the car's design, contributing to its sleek and modern aesthetic."
