There are no chrome accents or additional finishes that might suggest a different category like a wagon.\n- **Shape and Size**: The shape is distinctly that of a sedan, characterized by a long hood, short rear deck, and a sleek, aerodynamic profile. The windows are proportionally sized for a sedan, with a clear distinction between the front and rear sections.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The car features alloy wheels with a multi-spoke design, which are common in sedans but can vary widely. The side mirrors are body-colored, and there are no visible rearview camera indicators or additional features typically found on wagons.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The car has a sporty appearance due to the 2.0T quattro designation, suggesting it comes equipped with a turbocharged engine and all-wheel drive system.
