It is slightly curved at the top, following the shape of the roofline. The tail lights are integrated into the lower portion of the window, flanking both sides of the license plate area.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the \"Carbon Creations\" logo printed on the carbon fiber texture of the rear window.

This texture contrasts sharply with the smoothness of the car's paint.\n- **Shape and Size**: The text and logo are rectangular and positioned centrally on the rear window. They are large enough to be easily readable but not so large as to obstruct the view through the window.\n- **Unique Features**: The use of carbon fiber adds a sporty and premium aesthetic to the car.
