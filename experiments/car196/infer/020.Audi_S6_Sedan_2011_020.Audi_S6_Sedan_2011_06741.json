The headlights are sharp and angular, contributing to the modern aesthetic. The side mirrors are integrated into the door panels, and the wheels have a multi-spoke design.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The car appears to be a sedan model, likely a higher-end variant given the design and finish.
