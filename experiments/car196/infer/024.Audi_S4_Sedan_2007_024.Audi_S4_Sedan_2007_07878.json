It is usually large and prominently displayed, serving as a key identifier for the brand.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: Audi's grille often features a horizontal or vertical pattern with a central emblem (the four rings). The headlights are typically sleek and angular, contributing to the car's sporty and elegant appearance.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: Audi models can vary widely in design, but common features include LED lighting technology in the headlights and taillights, and a sophisticated grille design that reflects the brand's identity.\n\nSince the image only shows the rear of the car, these details pertain to the front grille and headlights, which are not present in the image."
