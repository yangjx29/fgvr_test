There are no visible patterns or textures other than the slight sheen from the paint.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The van has a rectangular shape with straight lines and sharp edges, characteristic of cargo vans designed for functionality over aesthetics. It appears to be mid-sized, likely intended for commercial use given its robust build and lack of passenger windows.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n  - **Sliding Doors**: The side profile reveals sliding doors on both sides, which are common in cargo vans for easy loading and unloading.\n  - **Tinted Windows**: The side windows appear to have a dark tint, providing privacy and reducing glare.\n  - **Rear Cargo Area**: The rear section of the van is open, indicating it is designed for carrying goods rather than passengers. The absence of rear windows further emphasizes its cargo-focused design.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**:\n  - **Front Grille**: The front grille is",

They are rectangular in shape, typical of modern vans.\n   - **Shape and Size:** The tail lights are positioned at the rear corners of the van, spanning horizontally across the back.
