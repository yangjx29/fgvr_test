The grille is rectangular in shape and spans a significant portion of the front bumper, covering the lower part of the car's face. It has a sleek, aerodynamic design that complements the overall sporty aesthetic of the vehicle. The grille features a subtle pattern of horizontal lines, adding to its visual complexity. There are no visible logos or emblems on the grille itself, which keeps the design clean and focused on the car's performance-oriented look. The grille's size is proportional to the car's overall dimensions, enhancing its aggressive stance on the track.",

The side mirrors have a simple, rounded shape, typical of performance cars, which helps reduce aerodynamic drag.\n\nThe door handles are integrated into the side panels of the car, appearing as small, circular recesses with a metallic sheen. They are located near the bottom of the doors, just above the tires, and are designed for easy access while maintaining a sleek profile. The handles are flush with the bodywork, contributing to the car's streamlined appearance.\n\nThese features collectively enhance the car's sporty aesthetic and functional design, distinguishing it from more traditional or less aerodynamic vehicles.",
            "The racing decal on the red Chevrolet Corvette features a white background with black text and numbers. The number \"26\" is prominently displayed in the center, surrounded by smaller text and logos. The decal includes various sponsor logos and text, such as \"TIRE RACK\" at the top, which is written in bold, uppercase letters. The decal also has a few small, colorful accents, possibly representing additional sponsors or design elements.\n\nThe decal's shape is rectangular and positioned on the driver's side door, extending slightly onto the hood. It is relatively large compared to the car's overall size, making it a noticeable feature. The texture appears smooth, typical of vinyl decals used in motorsports for durability and visibility. The edges of the decal are clean and well-defined, ensuring it adheres securely to the car's surface without any visible wrinkles or bubbles.\n\nThis decal distinguishes the car from standard production models by indicating its participation in a racing event. The presence of the \"TIRE RACK\" logo suggests a partnership with a tire manufacturer, which is common in motorsport sponsorship. The overall appearance is professional and designed to be easily readable from a distance, which is crucial for racing events where visibility is key."
