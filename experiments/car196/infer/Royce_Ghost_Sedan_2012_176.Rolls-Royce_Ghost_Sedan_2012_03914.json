The grille has a classic, elongated shape that spans the width of the car's front end, contributing to its luxurious and elegant look.\n\nThe emblem, located at the center of the grille, is a distinctive feature of Rolls-Royce. It appears as a small, circular logo with intricate detailing, likely featuring the company's name or a stylized representation of a horse's head, which is a traditional symbol associated with the brand. This emblem is smaller in size compared to the grille itself but stands out due to its fine craftsmanship and reflective surface, which catches the light and adds to the overall opulence of the vehicle.\n\nThe grille's design includes vertical slats that add depth and dimension, enhancing the visual appeal and sophistication of the car.

It features a subtle chrome trim along the bottom edge, adding to the vehicle's refined look. The bumper integrates seamlessly with the headlights and grille, creating a cohesive front fascia. The overall shape of the bumper is rounded and smooth, contributing to the car's elegant and sophisticated profile.\n\nDistinctive features include the intricate detailing around the grille, the chrome accents on the headlights and bumper, and the overall symmetry and balance of the design.
