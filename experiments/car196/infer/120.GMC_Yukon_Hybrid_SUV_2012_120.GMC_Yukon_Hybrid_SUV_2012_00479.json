They have a rectangular shape with a slight curve at the top edge.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The taillights appear smooth and glossy, typical of modern vehicle designs. There is no visible pattern or texture within the lenses.\n- **Shape and Size**: The taillights are large and positioned symmetrically on either side of the vehicle's rear. They are slightly angled outward, which is characteristic of SUVs like the Yukon XL.\n- **Unique Features**: The taillights are integrated into the rear bumper, which has a black lower section that extends horizontally across the width of the vehicle. This bumper section is a distinctive feature of the Yukon XL model.\n\n### Overall Shape:\n- **General Shape**: The vehicle has a boxy, robust shape typical of full-size SUVs. The rear end is wide and flat, with a prominent rear window that spans almost the entire width of the vehicle.\n- **Distinctive Features**: The rear window is large and dark, providing a clear view of the interior seating arrangement. The bumper is thick",

There are no visible hybrid branding elements such as a \"Hybrid\" badge or any hybrid-specific design features like a dual exhaust system or a different grille pattern.\n\nKey visual characteristics include:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The vehicle has a uniform white paint job with a matte finish. There are no visible textures or patterns other than the standard paint.\n- **Shape and Size**: The SUV is large and boxy, typical of full-size SUVs. It has a prominent rear window and a wide stance.\n- **Unique Features**: The rear features include a standard license plate holder, taillights, and a rear bumper. The GMC logo is prominently displayed on the right side of the bumper, and the \"Yukon XL\" model name is written below it.\n- **Special Characteristics**: There are no hybrid-specific features visible. The taillights appear to be standard, without any additional lighting or design indicative of hybrid technology.\n\nIn summary, the GMC Yukon XL in the image does not display any hybrid branding or design features that would differentiate it from a conventional gasoline-powered SUV."
