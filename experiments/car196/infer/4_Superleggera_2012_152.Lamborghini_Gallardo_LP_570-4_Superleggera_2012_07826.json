There are no visible textures or patterns within the taillight area itself; it maintains a clean and minimalist aesthetic.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The taillights are relatively small compared to the overall size of the car, which is characteristic of sports cars where weight reduction and aerodynamics are prioritized. They are positioned symmetrically at the rear corners of the vehicle, ensuring balance and enhancing the car's sporty profile.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The taillights feature a sharp, angular design with a slight upward curve at the top, giving them a modern and dynamic look.
