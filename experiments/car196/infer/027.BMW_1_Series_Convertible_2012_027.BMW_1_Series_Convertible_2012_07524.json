The side mirrors are also silver, matching the overall color scheme and contributing to the cohesive look. The windows appear tinted, providing privacy while maintaining a sleek silhouette. The convertible top is down, revealing the interior, which includes black seats and a dashboard that complements the car's sporty theme.\n\nThe front grille is prominent, featuring the iconic BMW kidney shape with horizontal slats.
