They have a clear lens covering and are integrated into the front bumper.

There are no visible textures or patterns on the bodywork, suggesting a standard paint job without any additional decorative elements.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**:\n   - The SUV has a boxy yet slightly rounded shape typical of SUVs, providing ample space for passengers and cargo.\n   - The wheels appear to be standard-sized for an SUV, with a diameter that is proportionate to the vehicle's overall size.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - The front grille is prominent and features horizontal slats, which are characteristic of certain Nissan models.\n   - The headlights are rectangular and positioned at the corners of the front fascia.\n   - The side mirrors are large and extend outward, providing good visibility.\n   - The windows are tinted, which is common for vehicles to reduce glare and heat inside.\n\n4. **Variations or Special Characteristics**:\n   - The wheels have a simple, multi-spoke design, which is common",

The texture is relatively uniform without any visible patterns. The shape of the tailgate is rectangular, typical for SUVs, and it spans the width of the rear of the vehicle. The rear lights are integrated into the tailgate design, forming a horizontal strip across the bottom. They are rectangular in shape and positioned side by side, with a slight curve at the top edge. There are no visible distinctive features such as additional lights or chrome accents, which helps in distinguishing this model from others with more elaborate tailgate designs.
