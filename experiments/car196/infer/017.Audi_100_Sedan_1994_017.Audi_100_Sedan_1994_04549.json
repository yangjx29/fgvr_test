It features a central air intake with a black grille insert, which is a characteristic feature of the C3 series. The bumper itself appears to be made of a matte black plastic material, contrasting with the white body of the car.\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The car's body is painted in a light silver or off-white color, which gives it a clean and classic look. The bumper and grille insert are black, providing a subtle contrast. The wheels are simple and appear to be alloy, with a multi-spoke design.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Audi badge on the grille is prominently displayed, indicating the brand.
