            "The front grille of the vehicle in the image is black with a textured finish, giving it a slightly rough appearance. The grille is large and spans the width of the front bumper, covering most of the lower portion of the vehicle's face. It features horizontal slats that are evenly spaced, contributing to a modern and robust aesthetic.\n\nThe Toyota emblem is prominently displayed at the center of the grille. It is silver in color and has a three-dimensional look, with a raised, embossed design that stands out against the black background of the grille. The emblem is circular with a small, intricate logo at its center, which is characteristic of Toyota's branding.\n\nThe grille's shape is rectangular, with a slightly curved top edge that follows the contour of the hood. This design element adds to the vehicle's angular yet sleek profile. The overall size of the grille is substantial, making it a defining feature of the vehicle's front end.\n\nNo other variations or special characteristics are immediately apparent in the grille itself, as it appears to be a standard design for this model year. However, the combination of the black grille, silver emblem, and the overall styling of the SUV suggests a focus on durability and a rugged, yet refined appearance.",
            "The vehicle in the image is a black Toyota SUV, specifically focusing on the headlight and bumper area.\n\n- **Color**: The headlights and bumper are black, matching the overall color of the vehicle. The finish appears smooth with no visible texture or patterns.\n  \n- **Shape and Size**: The headlights are rectangular with a slightly curved top edge, typical of many SUV designs. They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the front grille. The bumper is also black and integrates seamlessly with the headlights, featuring a horizontal grille design below them. The bumper has a robust, sturdy appearance, consistent with the SUV's overall design.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The headlights have clear lenses with a white illumination, and there are orange turn signal indicators integrated into the lower part of each headlight. The bumper includes a black plastic trim that runs horizontally across the center, adding a touch of contrast and enhancing the vehicle's rugged look.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The vehicle appears to be in good condition, with no visible damage to the headlights or bumper. The design elements, such as the integrated turn signals and the horizontal grille, are characteristic of certain models within the Toyota SUV lineup, making it distinct from other vehicles in terms of styling.",
            "The side profile of the vehicle in the image shows a black SUV with a shiny, reflective surface indicating a smooth, possibly metallic paint finish. The vehicle's body is robust, with a large, angular front grille that is characteristic of the Toyota brand. The headlights are rectangular and integrated into the grille design, with clear lenses and orange turn signal indicators.\n\nThe side mirrors are large and appear to be power-adjustable, with a dark-colored cover that matches the vehicle's body color. The windows are tinted, providing privacy and reducing glare. The side profile reveals a set of five-spoke alloy wheels, which are silver in color and contrast with the black body. The tires are thick and appear to be designed for off-road use, suggesting the vehicle is built for rugged terrain.\n\nThe door has a smooth, uninterrupted surface with no visible panel lines, giving it a sleek appearance. The window is framed by a dark-colored trim that matches the overall aesthetic of the vehicle. There are no visible dents or damage on the side, indicating the vehicle is well-maintained. The overall shape of the vehicle is boxy and sturdy, typical of an SUV design, with a high ground clearance suggested by the elevated position of the tires."
