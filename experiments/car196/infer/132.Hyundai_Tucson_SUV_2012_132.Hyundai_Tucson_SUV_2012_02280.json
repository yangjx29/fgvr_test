This ribbing is likely made of metal and provides both aesthetic appeal and structural integrity.\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is rectangular and spans the width of the front bumper, covering the area between the headlights and the hood. It is slightly larger than the headlight openings but smaller than the overall front end of the vehicle.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The Hyundai logo is prominently displayed at the center of the grille. It is a stylized \"H\" in a blue color, which stands out against the darker background of the grille. This logo is a distinctive feature that helps identify the make of the vehicle.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The grille design is sleek and modern, reflecting contemporary automotive styling trends. There are no additional emblems or logos visible on the grille itself, keeping it clean and uncluttered.\n\nThese characteristics collectively",

They are rectangular in shape, with a clean and modern look.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The headlights are positioned at the front corners of the vehicle, symmetrically placed on either side of the grille. They are large enough to cover the width of the front end, providing ample illumination for the driver.\n   - **Unique Features**: The headlights have a sleek, angular design that complements the overall aerodynamic profile of the SUV.\n\n2. **Bumper**:\n   - **Color**: The bumper appears to be a metallic gray or silver, matching the body color of the SUV.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The bumper has a smooth finish with no visible textures or patterns. It is designed to be robust, likely made of plastic or metal, to protect the vehicle during off-road conditions.\n   - **Shape and Size",

The text \"6MBH735\" is clearly visible in a standard font style, which is typical for vehicle registration plates. The plate is affixed to the front of the vehicle, centered below the grille. It has a standard size for North American vehicles, which is approximately 12 inches wide by 6 inches tall. There are no unique or distinctive features on the plate itself; it appears to be a standard issue plate without any additional symbols, logos, or special markings. The texture seems smooth and uniform, consistent with plastic or metal construction. The plate is positioned slightly above the ground, indicating the vehicle is parked or moving slowly on uneven terrain.",

They are positioned at the front corners of the vehicle, extending outward for visibility. The side mirrors appear to be standard in shape, with a slight curve to fit the contours of the car's body.\n\nThe door handles are also silver and located on the sides of the vehicle, near the rear quarter panel. They have a simple, rectangular shape with rounded edges for ergonomic handling. The handles are flush with the door surface, blending seamlessly into the vehicle's design.\n\nThe overall appearance of the side mirrors and door handles is consistent with typical automotive styling, featuring a metallic finish that contrasts with the darker gray color of the SUV. There are no visible patterns or unique features on these components; they are standard in design and function."
