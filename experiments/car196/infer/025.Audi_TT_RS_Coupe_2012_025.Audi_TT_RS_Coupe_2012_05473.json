It has a rectangular shape with slightly curved edges, giving it a modern and sleek appearance.\n\nThe Audi badge, located at the center of the grille, is a distinctive circular emblem with the word \"Audi\" written in a stylized font. The badge is silver with a black outline, creating a high-contrast look against the black grille. The Audi logo itself is a four-ring design, which is a hallmark of the brand and serves as a unique identifier.\n\nThe combination of the black grille with the silver Audi badge creates a striking contrast, making the front grille stand out as a key identifying feature of the vehicle.

The white paint appears uniform across the vehicle.\n- **Shape and Size**: The TT RS has a compact yet aerodynamic shape, typical of sports coupes. It is relatively small compared to full-sized sedans, with short overhangs and a low-slung profile.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n  - The front grille is large and features the iconic Audi logo, with a black mesh design that contrasts sharply with the white body.\n  - The headlights are angular and integrated into the front bumper, contributing to the aggressive styling.\n  - The side mirrors are body-colored, blending seamlessly with the white exterior.\n  - The wheels are multi-spoke alloy designs, adding to the sporty aesthetic.\n  - The side skirts and rear diffuser are black, providing a visual contrast and enhancing the car's performance-oriented appearance.\n\nThese features collectively",

They have a sharp, angular design that complements the overall aerodynamic profile.\n- **Unique Features**: The DRLs are a notable feature, providing a modern and functional element to the design. The headlight housing itself has a smooth, glossy finish.\n\n### Taillights:\n- **Color**: The taillights are not visible in the image, so their color cannot be determined from this perspective.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The taillight design is likely to match the headlight design, maintaining a consistent theme with sharp lines and a modern appearance.\n- **Shape and Size**: The taillights"
