Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The SUV is painted in a light gold or beige color with a smooth, glossy finish. There are no visible patterns or textures on the body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The SUV has a robust, elevated stance typical of SUVs, with a higher ground clearance and wider body compared to a sedan. It appears to be mid-sized, likely designed for family use or light commercial purposes.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The SUV has a prominent front grille, large wheels, and a high roofline, which are characteristic features of SUVs. The side mirrors are also large, enhancing visibility. The rear design includes a spare tire mounted on the back, a common feature in SUVs for added utility.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The SUV has a sliding door on the passenger side, which is often found in SUVs for easier access to the third row seats (if present). The overall proportions suggest it is built for both comfort and functionality, with a focus on spaciousness and versatility.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the SUV from a sedan, which typically has a sleeker, more streamlined profile and a lower",
