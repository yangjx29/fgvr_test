The taillights are integrated into the bodywork, featuring a smooth, curved shape with a subtle gradient from a darker shade at the top to a lighter shade at the bottom, giving them a sophisticated look. The taillights appear to have a clear lens with no visible patterns or textures.\n\nThe rear bumper is wide and low, contributing to the car's sporty aesthetic. It has a clean, uncluttered appearance with a slight upward curve at the edges, enhancing the vehicle's aerodynamic profile. The bumper is painted in the same light silver color as the rest of the car, maintaining a cohesive look.\n\nUnique features include the integrated taillights and the smooth, flowing lines of the rear bumper.
