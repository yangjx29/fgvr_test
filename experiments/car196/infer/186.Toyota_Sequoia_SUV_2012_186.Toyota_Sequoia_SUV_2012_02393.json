The paint appears uniform without any visible patterns or textures.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The body has a glossy finish, which enhances its sleek appearance. There are no visible textures or patterns on the bodywork itself; it maintains a clean and polished look.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The wheels are large, with a diameter that is proportionate to the SUV's size, typical for an SUV. They have a multi-spoke design, featuring a combination of straight and curved spokes that create a balanced and modern aesthetic. The tires appear to be standard all-season tires, suitable for various road conditions.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most noticeable feature is the large, prominent grille at the front, which is characteristic of the Toyota Sequoia. The grille is black and contrasts sharply with the silver body. The headlights are integrated into the grille, contributing to the vehicle's robust and sturdy look. The side mirrors are also large, matching the vehicle",

There are no visible patterns or textures that stand out.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The tailgate is rectangular and integrates seamlessly with the rear of the vehicle. It is slightly raised above the level of the rear bumper, which is also rectangular and flush with the ground. The bumper itself is wide and robust, typical of an SUV, providing protection for the underside of the vehicle.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The tailgate has a simple, clean design without any additional features like a spoiler or integrated lights. The rear bumper includes a small, circular reflector light near the bottom center, which is a standard safety feature.\n\n4. **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The tailgate and rear bumper do not have any unique or special characteristics that set them apart from other SUVs.
