It is positioned centrally and horizontally aligned with the taillights.\n- **Unique Features**: The badge features the word \"GENESIS\" in capitalized, bold letters, which is the name of the car model.

Here's a detailed breakdown:\n\n- **Color**: The taillights are primarily red with a glossy finish, which reflects light and enhances their visibility. The red color is consistent across both taillights.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The taillights have a smooth, polished surface with no visible texture or patterns. This contributes to a clean and minimalist aesthetic.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The taillights are rectangular in shape, with a slightly curved top edge. They are positioned horizontally along the rear of the car, spanning the width of the vehicle. Each taillight is large in relation to the car's overall size, making them a prominent feature.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The taillights feature a subtle, integrated design with a slight gradient effect, where the red color transitions smoothly into a darker shade at the bottom. This creates a sense of depth and sophistication. Additionally, there is a small, chrome-like accent near the center of each taillight, adding a touch of elegance.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The taillights are symmetrically placed and identical in design, which is typical for luxury vehicles aiming for a balanced and",
