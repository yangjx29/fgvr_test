It features a prominent horizontal chrome bar across the center, which adds a touch of elegance and contrast against the black plastic. The bumper also includes integrated fog light housings, which are not currently illuminated. The overall design is functional yet stylish, with a focus on durability and protection.\n\n- **Color, Texture, and Patterns**: The headlights have a matte finish, while the bumper has a glossy black plastic texture.
