The grille's shape is rectangular with rounded edges, fitting seamlessly into the car's design.\n\nThe Ford emblem, which is the distinctive logo used by Ford Motor Company, is positioned in the center of the grille. It is circular in shape and features the word \"FORD\" in capital letters, with a stylized \"F\" at the top. The emblem appears to be metallic and reflective, contrasting with the matte finish of the grille. Its size is relatively small compared to the overall size of the grille but is proportionate to the car's front end.\n\nThe emblem's unique feature is its classic design, which includes the iconic \"F\" and the word \"FORD,\" making it easily recognizable as a Ford logo.

The overall size is compact yet elongated, suitable for urban driving while still offering a sporty appearance.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The Mustang's design includes a prominent grille, sharp lines along the sides, and a fastback profile. The wheels are alloy, adding to the sporty aesthetic. The absence of a roof is the most distinctive feature, clearly identifying it as a convertible.\n",
