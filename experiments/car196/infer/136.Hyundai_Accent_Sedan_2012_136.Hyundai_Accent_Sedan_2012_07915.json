Here's a detailed description focusing on the side profile and door handles:\n\n- **Color**: The car is a vibrant red with a smooth, glossy finish. The paint appears uniform without any visible texture or patterns.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The car has a compact and streamlined shape typical of subcompact sedans. The doors are rectangular with slightly curved edges, and the windows are also rectangular, contributing to a clean and modern look. The side mirrors are integrated into the door panels, which are slightly curved at the top for aerodynamic purposes.\n\n- **Door Handles**: The door handles are silver in color, matching the alloy wheels and other metallic accents on the car. They are located on the lower part of the doors, just above the wheel arches. The handles are simple in design, with a smooth, rounded shape that blends seamlessly into the door's surface.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The car features a sleek, low-slung profile with a gently sloping roofline. The front grille is small and integrated into the hood, giving it a more compact appearance. The headlights are narrow and angular, adding to the modern aesthetic. The rear taillights are positioned low and horizontally aligned",

The taillights are positioned at the corners of the rear bumper, which is a standard feature for sedans. The bumper itself appears to be smooth and unadorned, with no visible chrome or decorative elements.\n\nThe taillights have a rectangular shape, typical of many modern car designs, and they are integrated seamlessly into the rear panel of the vehicle. The color of the taillights is a deep red, matching the body of the car, which helps maintain a cohesive look. There are no visible patterns or textures on the taillights; they appear smooth and glossy, reflecting some light.\n\nThe bumper is a solid, dark gray color, contrasting with the red of the car's body. It has a clean, straight edge and no additional features like fog lights or skid plates. The overall appearance is simple and functional, designed to blend well with the car's overall aesthetic while ensuring safety and visibility."
