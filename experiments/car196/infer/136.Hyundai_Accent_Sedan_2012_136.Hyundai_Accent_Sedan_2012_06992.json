They appear to be LED or high-intensity discharge (HID) lights, indicated by their bright white color and precise shape. The headlights are positioned symmetrically on either side of the grille, contributing to the car's balanced look.\n\nThe combination of the chrome grille, black border, and angular headlights creates a distinctive and recognizable front end for this Hyundai model. The design elements work together to give the car a sporty yet elegant appearance, distinguishing it from other vehicles in its category.",

The vehicle is painted in a vibrant red color, which contrasts sharply against the silver accents and black trim.

It has four doors, each featuring a set of silver door handles that match the other metallic elements of the car. The windows are tinted, providing privacy while maintaining a sleek appearance. The side mirrors are integrated into the body, contributing to the streamlined look.\n\nDistinctive features include the sharp lines running along the sides, the subtle curves at the rear wheel arches, and the overall balanced proportions. The car's size is relatively small compared to larger vehicles, making it ideal for urban driving and maneuverability.\n\nNo special variations or unique characteristics stand out beyond these standard features, as the car appears to be a standard model within its class.",

The taillights have a rectangular shape with rounded edges, giving them a modern and sleek appearance. They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the rear bumper.\n\nThe bumper itself is black and appears to be made of a matte material, contrasting with the glossy finish of the taillights. It has a slightly raised design, which adds depth and dimension to the rear end of the vehicle. The bumper also features a subtle horizontal line near the bottom, which could serve as a decorative element or a functional air intake.\n\nThe taillights are integrated into the bumper, making them appear as one cohesive unit. This design choice enhances the overall aesthetic of the car by maintaining a clean and streamlined look. There are no visible patterns or additional features on the taillights beyond their color and shape, which makes them stand out against the black bumper."
