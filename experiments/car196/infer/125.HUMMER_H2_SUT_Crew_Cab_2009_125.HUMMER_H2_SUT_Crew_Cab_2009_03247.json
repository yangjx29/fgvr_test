The surface appears clean and well-maintained, reflecting light and emphasizing its polished look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The vehicle has a large, imposing presence due to its substantial height and width. It is notably taller and wider than most SUVs, giving it a commanding stance. The body is rectangular with sharp edges, contributing to its rugged and utilitarian appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: \n  - **Lifted Suspension**: The Hummer H2 is equipped with a lifted suspension, evident from the increased ground clearance and the large tires mounted on black alloy wheels with a distinctive design.\n  - **Tire Size**: The tires are significantly larger than standard SUV tires, enhancing its off-road capabilities.\n  - **Roof Rack**: A roof rack is installed, suggesting utility for carrying additional cargo.\n  - **Side Graphics**: The side of the vehicle features bold \"HUMMER\" lettering in black, along with smaller text that reads \"H2\""
