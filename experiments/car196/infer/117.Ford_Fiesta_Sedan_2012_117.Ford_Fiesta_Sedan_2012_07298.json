The size is proportionate to the car's overall design, neither too large nor too small.\n- **Unique Features**: The headlights have a single lens design, which is common for this model. There are no additional decorative elements or unique designs.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The headlights are positioned at the front corners of the vehicle, slightly angled towards the center, enhancing the car's aerodynamic profile.\n\n### Taillights:\n- **Color**: The taillights are not clearly visible in the image, as they are located at the rear of the car, out of view. However, based on the model, they likely have a standard design with a combination of red and clear sections.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: Similar to the headlights, the taillights",
