They appear to be rectangular in shape, with a clear lens that covers the light source inside. The headlight housing is also silver, matching the grille, and there are no visible additional decorative elements around them.\n\nThe grille and headlights together form a cohesive front fascia that is characteristic of many minivan models. The horizontal bar design of the grille gives it a modern and somewhat utilitarian look, which is typical for vehicles in this category. There are no unique or distinctive features that set this particular grille apart from others in the same class; it is a standard design element that serves both functional and aesthetic purposes.",
            "The side mirrors and door handles in the image appear to be standard for a van, likely made of a metallic material with a silver finish. \n\n- **Color**: The side mirrors and door handles are silver, matching the overall color scheme of the vehicle, which is white. This uniformity suggests they are part of the same manufacturing batch.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The surface of the side mirrors and door handles appears smooth and reflective, typical of metal finishes used in automotive design. There are no visible textures or patterns other than the inherent sheen of the metal.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: \n  - **Side Mirrors**: They are rectangular in shape, with a slightly curved edge at the bottom, which is common for van mirrors to improve visibility. The size is relatively large compared to passenger car mirrors, designed to accommodate the larger field of view needed for driving a van.\n  - **Door Handles**: The door handles are also rectangular and positioned near the lower third of the doors. They are flush-mounted into the door panels, which is a practical design choice for vans as it helps reduce wind noise and aerodynamic drag.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: Both the side mirrors and door handles have a simple, functional design without any additional embellishments.",

They are rectangular in shape, with the amber section being slightly larger than the clear section above it.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The tail lights are positioned horizontally along the rear of the van, spanning a significant portion of the width. They are rectangular, with the amber section at the bottom and the clear section above it.\n   - **Unique Features**: There are no distinct markings or logos on the tail lights, making them appear quite plain and functional.\n\n2. **Rear Bumper**:\n   - **Color**: The rear bumper is white, matching the overall color of the van.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The bumper has a matte finish with no visible textures or patterns.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The bumper is wide and extends horizontally across the back of the van, providing a stable base for the tail"

It features a clean and utilitarian aesthetic, typical of family-oriented vehicles. The overall color scheme is monochromatic, with the body, grille, and other components all in white, creating a sleek and modern look.\n\n#### Front Grille and Headlights:\n- **Grille**: The front grille is silver with a textured finish that has a subtle metallic sheen. It has a horizontal bar design that spans the width of the bumper, covering a significant portion of the front fascia. The grille's texture adds a touch of sophistication while maintaining a functional appearance.\n- **Headlights**: Integrated into the grille, the headlights are rectangular with a clear lens. They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the grille and match the silver color of the grille. The housing is smooth and lacks any additional decorative elements, emphasizing a minimalist and practical design.\n\n#### Side Mirrors and Door Handles:\n- **Side Mirrors**: The side mirrors are rectangular with a slightly curved bottom edge, designed to enhance visibility.
