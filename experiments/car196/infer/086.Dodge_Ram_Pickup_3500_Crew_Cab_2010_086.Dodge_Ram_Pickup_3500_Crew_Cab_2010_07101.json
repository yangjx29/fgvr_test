The emblem is relatively small compared to the overall size of the grille but stands out due to its reflective surface and central placement.\n\nThis combination of a large, textured grille and the distinctive Ram emblem helps identify the vehicle as a Ram 3500.

The texture appears to be standard for a truck tailgate, likely made of metal or a composite material designed for durability. There are no visible patterns on the tailgate.\n\nThe rear badge for model and year identification is located near the center of the tailgate. It is rectangular in shape and positioned horizontally. The badge is white with black lettering, displaying \"RAM\" at the top and \"2500\" below it, indicating the model and series of the vehicle. The font is bold and clear, making it easy to read. The badge's size is proportionate to the tailgate, being neither too small nor too large, ensuring it is easily noticeable.\n\nNo other distinctive features or variations are apparent on the tailgate in this image. The overall appearance is consistent with typical Ram 2500 models, focusing on functionality and a straightforward design."
