The texture appears to be a combination of small ridges and possibly some metallic elements, contributing to a modern yet rugged look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is large and rectangular, spanning almost the entire width of the front bumper. It has a prominent horizontal bar at the top, which is a hallmark of Dodge's design language during that era.

This emblem is a key identifier for the Dodge brand. The surrounding area of the grille has a sleek, angular design, with sharp lines and a clean, polished look.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The grille design is consistent with the Magnum's sporty aesthetic, which was popular among muscle car enthusiasts.
