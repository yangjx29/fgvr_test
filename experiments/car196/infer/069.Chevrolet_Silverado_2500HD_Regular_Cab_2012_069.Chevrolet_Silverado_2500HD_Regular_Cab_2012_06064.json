            "The front grille of the vehicle in the image is a prominent feature, located centrally at the front of the truck. It has a dark gray color with a textured finish that appears slightly glossy, giving it a modern look. The grille's shape is rectangular and spans horizontally across the front, covering a significant portion of the vehicle's face.\n\nThe emblem, which is likely the manufacturer's logo, is positioned in the center of the grille. It is circular in shape and appears to be a metallic silver or chrome color, providing a contrast against the darker background of the grille. The emblem's size is relatively small compared to the overall size of the grille but is still noticeable and distinct. Its circular shape and reflective surface make it stand out as a key identifying feature of the vehicle.\n\nThe grille's design includes horizontal slats that extend from the emblem towards the edges of the grille, adding to its structured appearance. There are no visible variations or special characteristics in the grille itself; it maintains a consistent pattern throughout its length. This consistent design helps in distinguishing the grille from other similar vehicles by its uniformity and the central placement of the emblem.",
            "The vehicle in the image is an extended cab pickup truck. Here's a detailed description focusing on its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The truck appears to be a dark gray or charcoal color with a smooth, matte finish. There are no visible patterns or textures that stand out.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The extended cab configuration is evident as it has two doors for the rear seating area, which is larger than a standard single cab. This provides more space inside the truck bed and cabin, making it suitable for carrying more passengers or cargo.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The extended cab is characterized by its additional door and window, which extend further back compared to a single cab. The side mirrors are positioned higher and further back to accommodate the extended cab design. The overall shape of the truck is boxier due to the extra space provided by the extended cab.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The truck in the image does not have any visible special features such as chrome accents, unique wheel designs, or additional lighting. It appears to be a standard model without any customization or special edition features.\n\nThis description should help distinguish the extended cab configuration from other types of pickup trucks, particularly those with crew cabs, which typically have even more space and a third",

The vehicle appears to be a standard pickup truck with no distinguishing features such as a \"Hybrid\" badge, hybrid-specific logos, or unique color schemes that would typically indicate hybrid technology. The truck is shown in a neutral gray color with a matte finish, and there are no visible hybrid-related design elements like a dual fuel tank, hybrid-specific grille, or other hybrid indicators. If hybrid technology were present, it might include a badge on the front grille, a sticker on the side, or a logo near the fuel cap, none of which are apparent in this image."

It has a sleek, modern design with a matte finish, giving it a professional and robust look. The truck is positioned at a slight angle, showcasing its profile effectively.\n\n#### Front Grille and Emblem:\n- **Grille**: The front grille is rectangular and horizontally oriented, covering a significant portion of the vehicle's face. It has a textured, slightly glossy finish that enhances its modern aesthetic. The grille is dark gray, complementing the overall color scheme of the truck.\n- **Emblem**: Positioned centrally within the grille, the emblem is circular and metallic silver or chrome in color. Its size is relatively small compared to the grille but is distinct and noticeable. The emblem's reflective surface contrasts sharply with the darker background, making it a key identifier.\n\n#### Cab Configuration:\n- **Extended Cab**: The truck clearly features an extended cab configuration, identifiable by the presence of two doors for the rear seating area. This design provides additional space both inside the cabin and in the truck bed, making it suitable for carrying more passengers or cargo.\n- **Color and Finish**: The truck has a smooth, matte finish, which is consistent",
