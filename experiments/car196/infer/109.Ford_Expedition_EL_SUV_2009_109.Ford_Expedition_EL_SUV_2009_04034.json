            "The vehicle in the image is a Ford Expedition, identifiable by its distinct grille design and overall shape. Here's a detailed description focusing on the headlights and bumper:\n\n1. **Headlights**:\n   - **Color**: The headlights appear to be clear or light-colored, possibly white or a slightly yellowish tint, which is typical for many vehicles.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The headlights have a smooth surface with no visible textures or patterns. They are rectangular in shape, with a clean and modern look.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The headlights are large and positioned at the front corners of the vehicle, extending horizontally across the front. They are symmetrical and aligned with the vehicle’s centerline.\n   - **Unique Features**: The headlights have a sleek, angular design, contributing to the Expedition's robust yet refined appearance.\n\n2. **Bumper**:\n   - **Color**: The bumper appears to be silver or chrome, reflecting light and giving it a metallic sheen.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The bumper has a smooth, polished finish with no visible textures or patterns. It is wide and spans the width of the vehicle, providing a substantial base for the headlights and grille.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The bumper is broad and low to",
            "The side mirrors of the vehicle in the image appear to be silver in color, matching the overall metallic finish of the car. They have a smooth, reflective surface with no visible texture or patterns. The shape is typical for a modern SUV, with a slightly curved design that extends outward from the body. The mirrors are large enough to provide a wide field of view, which is common for vehicles designed for passenger comfort and safety.\n\nThe windows are tinted, giving them a darker appearance compared to the silver exterior. The tinting is uniform across the glass, suggesting a single layer of tint applied to the entire window. The windows are framed by black trim, which contrasts with the silver body of the car. The front windshield is large and rectangular, while the side windows are also rectangular but slightly smaller in size. The rear windows are not fully visible in the image, but they likely follow a similar design pattern.\n\nNo unique or distinctive features are immediately apparent on the side mirrors or windows that would set this vehicle apart from others in its category. The design is standard for an SUV, focusing on functionality and practicality rather than aesthetic differentiation.",
