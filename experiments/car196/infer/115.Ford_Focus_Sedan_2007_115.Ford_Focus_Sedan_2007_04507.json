The badge is positioned just above the grille's center and is surrounded by a thin, silver ring, which contrasts subtly against the black background of the grille. This design element is consistent with Ford's branding and helps to clearly identify the make of the vehicle.\n\nThe overall shape of the grille is symmetrical and balanced, contributing to the car's sleek and contemporary aesthetic.

They are proportionate to the car's overall size, with a width that allows for comfortable entry and exit while maintaining a streamlined look.\n- **Unique Features**: The doors feature standard handles located near the front and rear, which are likely made of a durable material like plastic or metal. There are no visible decorative elements or patterns on the doors, emphasizing a clean and minimalist design.\n\n### Window Shape:\n- **Shape**: The windows are rectangular, with a slight curve at the top to match the car's roofline. This design helps to reduce wind noise and improve aerodynamics.\n-",

Its shape is rectangular, with rounded edges, fitting seamlessly into the design of the rear bumper.\n- **Unique Features**: There are no visible logos or text on the badge itself; it is purely decorative. This simplicity makes it stand out as a subtle yet elegant feature.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The badge's design is consistent with Ford's styling cues during the era when this model was produced, which typically includes clean lines and a minimalist approach to branding.\n\nThis badge, along with the taillights, contributes to the overall modern and understated aesthetic of the Ford Focus."
