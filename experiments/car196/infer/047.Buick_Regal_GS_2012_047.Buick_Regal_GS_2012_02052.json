The grille is painted in a dark color, likely black or dark gray, which contrasts sharply with the white body of the car.\n\nThe grille's shape is rectangular and spans across the width of the front bumper, covering the entire space between the headlights and the hood. Its size is substantial, making it a focal point of the vehicle's front end. The horizontal bars within the grille have a smooth texture and are evenly spaced, creating a clean and polished appearance.\n\nThere are no visible logos or emblems on the grille itself, suggesting a minimalist design approach. The grille's edges are well-defined, contributing to the overall aesthetic of the car's front end. This design choice helps to emphasize the car's sporty and contemporary style while maintaining a sense of elegance.",

The size of the wheel appears to be standard for a sedan, fitting well within the overall proportions of the vehicle. There are no visible patterns or textures on the wheel itself; it maintains a smooth, clean look. The wheel's design is distinctive due to its simple yet elegant spoke pattern, which contrasts with more complex or ornate designs often seen on luxury vehicles. This simplicity makes it stand out as a practical yet stylish choice for the car.",
