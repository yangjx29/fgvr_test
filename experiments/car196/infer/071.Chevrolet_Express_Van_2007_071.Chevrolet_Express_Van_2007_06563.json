            "The rear side panel of the vehicle in the image appears to be part of a stretched version of a van, likely a Chevrolet Express or GMC Savana, given the design and model-specific details. Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The panel is primarily white, consistent with the overall color of the van. There are no visible patterns or textures that deviate from a smooth, painted surface.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The panel is elongated compared to a standard van, indicating it has been stretched. This modification increases the length of the rear side, extending further back than what would be typical for a non-stretched model. The shape remains rectangular, maintaining the standard profile of a van's rear side.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most noticeable feature is the extended length of the panel. This stretch is achieved through modifications to the frame and body panels, allowing for more passenger space or cargo capacity. The rear window is also larger due to the stretched design, providing better visibility and light penetration into the rear section of the van.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The stretched panel may have additional structural supports or reinforcements to maintain stability and integrity during the stretching process. The rear bumper and taillights appear to be standard",
            "The rear window and tailgate area of the vehicle in the image is predominantly white, matching the overall color of the van. The surface appears smooth with no visible texture or patterns, indicating a standard finish typical for commercial vans.\n\nThe rear window is large and rectangular, spanning almost the entire width of the rear doors. It has a dark tint, which is common for passenger vans to reduce glare and heat inside. The window is divided into two sections by a vertical frame, likely for structural support and to allow for easier cleaning.\n\nThe tailgate is also white and extends horizontally across the back of the van. It features a small, rectangular license plate holder at the bottom right corner, which holds a license plate that is partially visible. The tailgate has a slight curve at the top, following the contour of the rear roofline. There are no visible modifications or unique features on the tailgate itself; it appears to be a standard design for this model of van.\n\nA yellow metal stand is positioned next to the tailgate, possibly used for securing items or as part of a towing system. This stand adds a contrasting color to the otherwise monochromatic scene.\n\nOverall, the rear window and tailgate area appear unmodified and consistent with the standard design of this type of van.",
            "The vehicle in the image appears to be a white van with a stretched body, indicating it is likely a stretched version rather than a standard model. Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The van is predominantly white with a smooth, matte finish. There are no visible patterns or textures other than the natural wear and slight discoloration on the lower rear bumper area.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The van has an elongated body compared to a standard van, suggesting it is designed for extended passenger capacity. The rear section, particularly the side windows and rear doors, extends further back than what would be typical for a standard van.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most noticeable feature is the extended rear section, which includes additional side windows and a larger rear door. This design is characteristic of stretched vans, often used for transporting more passengers or as limousines.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The presence of a yellow tow bar attached to the rear bumper suggests that the van may be equipped for towing or recovery purposes. Additionally, the overall condition of the van shows some signs of use, such as minor scratches and wear on the paint and body.\n\nIn summary, the elongated body, additional side windows, and rear door,"
