Here's a detailed description focusing on the side profile:\n\n- **Color**: The car is painted in a dark metallic color, likely black or dark gray, with a smooth and glossy finish that reflects light.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The surface appears to be a standard automotive paint with no visible textures or patterns other than the natural sheen of the paint.\n- **Shape and Size**: The BMW X5 has a robust and boxy shape typical of SUVs, with a long hood and a short rear deck. It is larger compared to a sedan, with a higher ground clearance and wider stance. The side profile shows a strong shoulder line running along the top of the doors, which is characteristic of the X5 model.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: \n  - The front grille is large and prominently features the BMW logo at the center.\n  - The headlights are sleek and angular, contributing to the modern aesthetic.\n  - The side mirrors are large and integrated into the door panels, providing good visibility.\n  - The wheels are alloy, with a multi-spoke design that complements the overall look.\n  - The side steps (fender flares",

It is rectangular in shape and appears to be made of a metallic material with a reflective surface, giving it a silver or chrome-like appearance. The badge is relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle but is prominently positioned for visibility.\n\nThe badge features the BMW logo at the top, which is a circular emblem with the iconic BMW \"B\" in the center. Below the logo, there is text indicating the model and year. The text is likely in a sans-serif font, white in color, and contrasts sharply against the metallic background. The font size is moderate, allowing for clear readability.\n\nThere are no visible variations or special characteristics on the badge itself; it follows the standard design typical of BMW vehicles. The badge's position and design ensure it is easily identifiable as part of the vehicle's branding and model identification system."
