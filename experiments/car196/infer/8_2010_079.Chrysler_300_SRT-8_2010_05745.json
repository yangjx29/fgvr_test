It is circular in shape and features a gold-colored emblem with a stylized design, likely representing the Chrysler logo. This badge is small compared to the overall size of the grille but stands out due to its metallic finish and distinct shape.\n\nThe combination of the textured grille, the large size of the grille relative to the car's front, and the central placement of the Chrysler badge make it a distinctive feature.

They are circular and positioned at the front corners of the vehicle, framing the grille effectively.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The circular shape is a hallmark of the Chrysler 300C's design language during its generation. The headlights also feature integrated daytime running lights (DRLs) that are visible as smaller circular elements within the larger headlight units, enhancing visibility and safety.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The headlights have a dual-lamp configuration, with the main beam",
