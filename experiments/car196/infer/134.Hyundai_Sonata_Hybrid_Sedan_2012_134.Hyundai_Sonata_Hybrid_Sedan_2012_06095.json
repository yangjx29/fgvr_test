They appear to have a clear lens with a smooth texture, and there are no visible patterns or designs. The headlight covers are a dark gray or black color, which contrasts with the red body of the car. The size of the headlights is standard for sedans, neither overly large nor small.\n\n- **Taillights**: The taillights are also rectangular and located at the rear corners of the car. They share a similar design aesthetic with the headlights, featuring a clear lens and a dark gray/black cover. The taillights are slightly larger than the headlights due to their placement at the back of the vehicle. There are no visible patterns or designs on the taillights, maintaining a clean and simple appearance.\n\n- **Color and Texture**: Both the headlights and taillights have a glossy finish, reflecting light and giving them a polished look.
