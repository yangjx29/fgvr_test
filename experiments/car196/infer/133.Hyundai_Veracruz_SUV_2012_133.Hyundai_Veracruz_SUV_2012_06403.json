It is positioned centrally within the grille and is relatively small compared to the overall size of the grille itself. The emblem's design includes a stylized logo that is characteristic of Hyundai vehicles, featuring a combination of curves and lines that form a recognizable pattern.\n\nThe grille's texture and the emblem's placement contribute to the vehicle's modern and sleek aesthetic.

They are relatively large compared to the overall size of the vehicle, contributing to a bold and assertive look.\n   - **Unique Features**: The headlights feature integrated daytime running lights (DRLs) that are visible as thin, horizontal lines below the main headlight units. This design element adds to the modern aesthetic.\n\n2. **Bumper**:\n   - **Color**: The bumper is a darker shade of gray, contrasting with the white body of the car.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The bumper has a matte finish, which is typical for bumpers to provide a durable and protective surface.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The bumper is wide and low to the ground, enhancing the vehicle's stance",

The wheels are alloy, featuring a multi-spoke design with a silver finish that contrasts subtly against the white paint. Each wheel appears to be of standard size for an SUV, providing both aesthetic appeal and practicality.\n\nThe SUV's side profile showcases a modern and robust design, with a prominent front grille and sharp, angular headlights that contribute to its contemporary look. The windows are tinted, adding a touch of privacy and style. The vehicle's overall appearance is polished and well-maintained, suggesting it is either new or very well cared for.\n\nDistinctive features include the Hyundai emblem on the grille and the \"Coastal\" text at the bottom of the image, which might indicate a dealership or model name.
