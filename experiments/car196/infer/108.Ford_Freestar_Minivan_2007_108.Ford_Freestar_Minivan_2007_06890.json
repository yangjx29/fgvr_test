The mirror reflects some of the surroundings, indicating it is functional.\n\nThe front windshield is large and spans the width of the vehicle, providing a clear view for the driver. It has a dark tint, which is common for windshields to reduce glare and improve visibility. The windshield wipers are mounted at the top center and appear to be in good condition, with no visible signs of wear.\n\nThe rear window is also visible and is similarly dark-tinted, matching the front windshield. This tinting helps maintain privacy and reduces heat inside the vehicle. The rear window is larger than the front windshield, as it extends further back towards the rear of the vehicle.\n\nOverall, the side mirrors and windows are standard features for a car, with no unique or distinctive features noted beyond their typical design and functionality. The color is primarily black for the mirrors and dark for the windows, which is consistent with many vehicles."
