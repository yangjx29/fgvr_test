The taillights are red in color, which is typical for brake lights, and they appear to be integrated into the rear bumper seamlessly. There are no visible patterns or textures on the taillights themselves; they maintain a smooth surface. The taillights are relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, emphasizing their importance as a safety feature. The design is clean and minimalistic, with no additional decorative elements, which is consistent with BMW's aesthetic. The taillights are positioned symmetrically on either side of the rear bumper, further enhancing the car's balanced appearance.",
