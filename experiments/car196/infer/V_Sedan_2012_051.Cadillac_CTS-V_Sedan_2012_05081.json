            "The front grille of the Cadillac CTS-V is a prominent feature, occupying a significant portion of the vehicle's front fascia. It is painted in a dark gray color, which contrasts with the lighter body of the car. The grille has a textured, almost honeycomb-like pattern, giving it a rugged yet sophisticated appearance.\n\nThe grille's shape is rectangular and spans horizontally across the front, flanked by two large, angular headlight units. The emblem, located at the center of the grille, is a silver, three-dimensional Cadillac crest. It is circular in shape and features intricate detailing, including a central star and surrounding radiating lines. This emblem is a hallmark of Cadillac's luxury brand identity and serves as a distinctive identifier for the vehicle.\n\nThe grille's size is substantial, covering a large area of the front bumper, which emphasizes its importance as both an aesthetic element and a functional component for air intake. The combination of the dark gray color, textured pattern, and the silver emblem creates a visually striking contrast that sets this grille apart from other automotive grilles.",
            "The side profile of the Cadillac CTS-V showcases a sleek, dark gray body with a glossy finish that reflects light, emphasizing its smooth contours and aerodynamic shape. The car's side features a prominent door handle integrated into the smooth surface, which is a subtle yet functional detail. The wheels are large, with a multi-spoke alloy design that adds a sporty aesthetic. Each spoke is finished in a polished silver tone, contrasting with the dark gray body. The tires appear to be high-performance, complementing the vehicle's performance-oriented appearance.\n\nThe overall shape of the car is elongated and low to the ground, typical of a luxury sports sedan. The side mirrors are also dark gray, blending seamlessly with the body, and they have a modern, aerodynamic design. The windows are tinted, adding to the car's sophisticated look. The side profile is marked by clean lines and a lack of excessive ornamentation, focusing instead on a minimalist yet powerful design language. This combination of color, texture, and shape distinguishes it from more boxy or less refined sedans, highlighting its status as a high-performance vehicle.",
            "The interior dashboard and steering wheel of the Cadillac CTS-V shown in the image exhibit a blend of luxury and performance-oriented design elements.\n\n- **Color**: The dashboard is primarily black with a glossy finish, which contrasts sharply with the lighter gray of the seats. This color scheme contributes to a sleek and sophisticated appearance, typical of high-end vehicles.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The dashboard has a smooth, polished surface with subtle stitching along the edges, adding a touch of elegance. The center console and door panels feature a more textured material, possibly leather or a leather-like synthetic, which provides a luxurious feel and contrast to the smoother dashboard.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The steering wheel is large and ergonomically designed, with a diameter that appears substantial for a sedan. It has a sporty shape with a flat bottom, which is common in high-performance vehicles to improve driving dynamics. The wheel itself is wrapped in a dark material, likely leather, and features multiple control buttons and a prominent logo at the center.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The steering wheel includes paddle shifters on the left side, indicating the car's capability for manual gear shifting. The center console houses a gear selector with a modern, minimalist design, and there are additional controls for climate"
