The side profile showcases a flowing line from the front fender to the rear, accentuated by the large, prominent wheels and the wide stance. The doors are large and appear to be made of a premium material, likely leather or a similar high-quality fabric, contributing to the luxurious feel.\n\n3. **Unique Features**:\n   - **Door Design**: The doors have a unique shape with a curved top edge that slopes down towards the rear, creating a smooth transition into the rear section of the car. The door panels seem to have a slightly textured finish, possibly with a subtle grain or pattern, adding to the tactile quality.\n   - **Side Ventilation**: There are visible air vents along the sides of the car, which are integrated into the door panels.
