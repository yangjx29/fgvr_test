It is relatively small compared to the overall size of the car but prominent enough to be easily recognizable.\n- **Unique Features**: The Hyundai emblem is a stylized \"H\" with a circular design around it, which is a distinctive feature of the brand. The text \"Veracruz\" is also visible below the emblem, indicating the model of the vehicle.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: There are no additional variations or special characteristics noted on the badge itself; it adheres to the standard design of Hyundai badges.\n\nThis combination of color, texture, shape, and unique features makes the Hyundai badge easily distinguishable from other manufacturers' logos.",
