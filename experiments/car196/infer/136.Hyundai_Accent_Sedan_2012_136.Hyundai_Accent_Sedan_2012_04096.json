The emblem's design is simple yet distinctive, making it easily recognizable as part of the Hyundai brand.\n\nThe grille itself is relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, occupying a significant portion of the front fascia. Its shape is rectangular with slightly curved edges, fitting seamlessly into the car's aerodynamic design. The black color contrasts sharply with the red body of the car, enhancing its visibility and prominence. There are no visible variations or special characteristics in the grille; it appears standard for this model.",

They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the front grille, which is black and features a horizontal chrome bar across the center. The bumper is also black and integrates seamlessly with the grille, providing a cohesive look. The bumper has a subtle curve at the bottom, adding a touch of elegance. The car's body is a glossy red, reflecting light and giving it a polished appearance. The overall design of the headlights and bumper is modern and functional, typical of contemporary compact cars.",

The plate is mounted centrally at the front of the vehicle, below the grille. It has a standard size for such plates, fitting snugly within the designated space. The plate's edges are clean and straight, with no visible wear or damage. The black text contrasts sharply against the white background, making it easily readable. There are no unique or distinctive features on the plate itself; it is a standard issue."
