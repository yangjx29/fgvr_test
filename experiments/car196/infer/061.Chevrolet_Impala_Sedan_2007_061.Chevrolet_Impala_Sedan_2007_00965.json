They have a single bulb configuration, which is typical for older model vehicles like the Impala. The bulbs appear to be standard halogen types, emitting a bright white light when illuminated.\n\n- **Front Bumper**: The front bumper is a solid, smooth design with a horizontal chrome bar running across the center, which is characteristic of the Impala's styling. Below the chrome bar, there is a black plastic lower section that houses the fog lights and possibly the license plate area. The fog lights are integrated into the bumper, appearing as small, rectangular units flanking the main grille area.\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The car is painted in a light beige or cream color, which is common for this model year. The paint appears to be in good condition without visible scratches or dents.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The headlights are positioned at the corners of the front fascia, with a moderate distance between them. The overall shape of the front end is boxy, reflecting the design language of mid-2000s sedans. The bumper",

The side profile showcases a sleek, four-door sedan design with a smooth, curved body. The wheels are standard alloy rims, likely 16 inches in diameter, with a simple five-spoke design. The tires appear to be in good condition, with no visible signs of wear.\n\nThe car's color is a solid white, which is common for vehicles in this category, providing a clean and classic look. There are no visible patterns or textures on the bodywork, suggesting a smooth finish typical of modern sedans. The side mirrors are integrated into the door panels, and the windows are tinted, adding a touch of privacy while maintaining a sleek appearance.\n\nThe overall design is straightforward and functional, with no unique or distinctive features that set it apart from other sedans of a similar era. The wheel design is unremarkable, consistent with many mass-produced vehicles of the time. This particular Impala appears to be in good condition, with no visible dents or scratches, indicating it has been well-maintained."
