This ribbing is consistent across the entire surface.\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is rectangular and spans the width of the front fascia, covering the area directly below the headlights and above the bumper. It is large enough to dominate the front face of the truck.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The grille includes a central horizontal bar that separates the upper and lower sections. This bar is also black and matches the overall color scheme of the grille. The Dodge logo is prominently displayed at the center of the upper section, adding a distinctive brand identifier.\n\nThese characteristics make the grille a distinctive feature that helps identify the vehicle as a Dodge model, particularly within the context of the Weber Chevrolet dealership advertisement.",

Here's a detailed description focusing on the side profile:\n\n- **Color**: The truck is uniformly white, with no visible patterns or textures other than the standard paint finish.\n- **Shape and Size**: The vehicle has a robust, boxy shape typical of full-size trucks, with a prominent front grille and large headlights. The crew cab design provides ample space for passengers, indicated by the two doors visible on the side.\n- **Wheel Design**: The wheels are standard alloy rims with a five-spoke design, common in trucks of this era. They appear to be in good condition, with no visible signs of wear or damage.\n- **Body Lines**: The body lines are clean and straightforward, with a straight roofline and a strong shoulder line running along the sides. The fender flares are noticeable, adding to the truck's muscular appearance.\n- **Unique Features**: The front grille is a key feature, with a horizontal bar design that is characteristic of Dodge vehicles. The headlights are rectangular and positioned low on the front, enhancing the truck's rugged look.\n\nThis description should help distinguish the Dodge Dakota from other similar trucks based on its specific design elements and features.",
