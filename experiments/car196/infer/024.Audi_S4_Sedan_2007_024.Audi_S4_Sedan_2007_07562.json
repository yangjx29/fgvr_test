They appear to be LED or high-performance halogen lights, as indicated by their bright white illumination and modern look. The headlight housing is also dark, matching the grille, and there is a small orange reflector located below the main headlight unit, adding a subtle accent.\n\nThe combination of the dark grille, the angular headlights, and the orange reflector creates a distinctive and sporty appearance, distinguishing this Audi from other sedans in terms of its front-end styling.",

They have a five-spoke pattern with a central hubcap that matches the car's overall aesthetic.\n- **Unique Features:** The spokes are evenly spaced and have a slight outward curve, giving them a sporty look. The hubcap has a logo, though it is not clearly visible in the image.\n- **Special Characteristics:** The wheels are fitted with low-profile tires, which enhance the car's sporty appearance and improve handling.\n\nOverall, the combination of the vibrant blue paint, the silver multi-spoke wheels, and the low-profile tires makes this car stand out as a stylish and performance-oriented vehicle.",
