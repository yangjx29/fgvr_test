The grille is painted in a dark color, likely black or dark gray, which contrasts sharply with the vibrant orange body of the car. The texture appears smooth and polished, reflecting light and emphasizing the car's high-quality finish.\n\nThe emblem, located centrally within the grille, is a distinctive circular design. It features a stylized, possibly metallic or chrome-like finish, giving it a three-dimensional appearance. The emblem's design includes intricate detailing, such as a central motif that could be interpreted as a shield or crest, adding to its unique character. The size of the emblem is proportionate to the overall grille, making it a focal point of the front fascia.\n\nThe grille's shape is rectangular, with slightly curved edges that blend seamlessly into the car's aerodynamic contours. This design not only enhances the car's aesthetic appeal but also contributes to its performance by improving airflow and cooling efficiency.
