They feature a deep red color with a glossy finish, which contrasts sharply with the silver body of the car. The taillights have a subtle gradient effect, transitioning from a darker shade at the top to a lighter hue towards the bottom, enhancing their three-dimensional appearance.\n\nThe rear bumper is wide and integrates seamlessly with the taillights. It has a matte black finish, providing a stark contrast to the glossy red of the taillights. The bumper includes two prominent exhaust outlets on each side, which are circular and positioned symmetrically. These outlets are also black, matching the bumper's color, and have a slightly raised, textured surface for a sporty aesthetic. The overall shape of the bumper is smooth and aerodynamic, contributing to the car's aggressive stance.\n\nThe combination of the red taillights, black bumper, and dual exhaust outlets creates a distinctive look that sets this BMW apart from other vehicles in its category. The clean lines and precise engineering are characteristic of high-performance sports cars like the BMW M3."
