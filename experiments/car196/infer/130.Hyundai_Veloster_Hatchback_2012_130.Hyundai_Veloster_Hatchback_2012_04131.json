They are relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, contributing to its sporty aesthetic.\n- **Unique Features**: The headlights feature integrated daytime running lights (DRLs) that are visible as thin, horizontal lines within the main headlight assembly. This is a common design element in modern cars for improved visibility during low-light conditions.\n\n### Taillights:\n- **Color**: The taillights are also clear or light-colored, consistent with the headlights.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: Similar to the headlights, the taillights have a smooth, glossy finish without any visible texture or patterns.\n- **Shape and Size**: The taillights are rectangular and located at the rear",

The paint seems to have a slight sheen, indicating a high-quality finish.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**:\n   - **Side Profile**: The car has a compact yet aerodynamic shape, characterized by a short front overhang, a long hood, and a sloping rear end. The roofline is slightly curved, adding to the sporty aesthetic.\n   - **Wheels**: The wheels are alloy, featuring a multi-spoke design with a silver finish that contrasts nicely against the black body. The spokes are thin and evenly spaced, contributing to a lightweight and stylish appearance.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - The side mirrors are integrated into the door panels, which is a common feature in modern vehicles for a streamlined look.\n   - The rear spoiler is subtle but noticeable, enhancing the car"
