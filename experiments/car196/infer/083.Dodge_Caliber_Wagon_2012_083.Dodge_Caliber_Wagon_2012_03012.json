It has a horizontal orientation with vertical slats that are not visible due to the angle of the photo.\n\nThe Dodge emblem is prominently displayed at the center of the grille.

They are positioned at the corners of the front fascia, flanking the grille. The headlight housing appears to have a smooth, slightly curved surface, which is typical for this model.\n\n- **Taillights**: The taillights are not fully visible in the image, but based on the model, they likely feature a horizontal design with a combination of red and amber lights. The taillight assembly is integrated into the rear bumper, following the body lines of the car.\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The car is painted in a metallic gray color, which reflects light and has a smooth finish. There are no visible textures or patterns on the bodywork apart from the natural reflections of the paint.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The car has a compact, boxy shape characteristic of the Caliber model. The front end is slightly elevated compared to the rear, giving it a sporty yet practical appearance. The wheels are standard-sized for the model, with a simple five-spoke alloy design.\n\n- **Unique",
