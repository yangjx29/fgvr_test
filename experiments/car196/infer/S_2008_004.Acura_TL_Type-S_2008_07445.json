This texture adds depth and contrast against the car's maroon body color.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The grille features a horizontal ribbed design with a series of parallel lines running across its width. These ribs are not uniform in thickness, creating a subtle variation in texture that enhances the visual appeal.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is rectangular in shape and spans the width of the car's front end, making it a large and central element. It is positioned centrally below the headlights and above the bumper, framing the Acura emblem prominently.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The grille includes a chrome accent bar at the top, which runs horizontally across the center. This bar is slightly raised and contrasts with the rest of the grille, adding a touch of elegance. The Acura emblem, located in the center of the grille, is a polished chrome circle with the brand name \"Acura\" inscribed within it. The emblem is circular and stands out due to its reflective",

They are relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, contributing to a bold and aggressive look.\n- **Unique Features**: The headlights have integrated daytime running lights (DRLs) visible as thin, horizontal lines below the main beam, which enhance visibility during low-light conditions.\n\n### Bumper:\n- **Color**: The bumper is painted in the same maroon color as the rest of the car, maintaining a cohesive appearance.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The bumper has a matte finish, contrasting slightly with the glossy headlights and hood. It appears to be made of plastic or a similar material.\n- **Shape and Size**: The bumper is wide and low, extending horizontally across the front of the car. It includes",
