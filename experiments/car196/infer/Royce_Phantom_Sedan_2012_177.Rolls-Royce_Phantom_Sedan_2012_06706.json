This pattern is consistent across the entire grille surface.\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is rectangular and spans the width of the front bumper, covering the entire horizontal space between the headlights. It is large in proportion to the car's overall size, emphasizing its luxurious nature.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The grille features the iconic Rolls-Royce \"Spirit of Ecstasy\" hood ornament, a small, elegant figure that sits atop the grille. This ornament is a hallmark of Rolls-Royce vehicles and is a distinctive feature that sets them apart from other luxury brands.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The grille design includes vertical slats that add to its elegance and airiness. These slats are evenly spaced and contribute to the car's refined appearance.\n\nThese characteristics collectively make the grille a defining element of the vehicle's luxurious and prestigious",

It is a rectangular shape with rounded edges, measuring approximately 10 cm in length and 3 cm in height. The badge has a metallic silver color with a reflective surface, giving it a polished and premium appearance.\n\nThe badge's texture appears smooth and glossy, which enhances its visibility and adds to the luxurious feel of the car. There are no visible patterns or intricate designs on the badge itself; it is a simple yet elegant emblem. The \"R\" logo, which is the hallmark of Rolls-Royce, is prominently displayed in the center of the badge. The \"R\" is capitalized, bold, and slightly raised, making it stand out against the metallic background.\n\nThis badge is distinctive because it is a hallmark of Rolls-Royce vehicles, immediately identifying the brand and model. Its placement and design are consistent across all Rolls-Royce models, serving as a recognizable symbol of luxury and craftsmanship.",

There are no visible patterns or textures other than the subtle reflections and highlights that emphasize the car's sleekness.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The vehicle has a long, low-slung profile typical of luxury sedans, designed for comfort and prestige. The proportions are balanced, with a slightly extended rear end that houses the taillights and exhaust system. The windows are large and wrap around the sides, contributing to an airy and spacious feel inside. The wheels are large and feature multi-spoke alloy rims, adding to the luxurious aesthetic.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the prominent \"Spirit of Ecstasy\" hood ornament, a hallmark of Rolls-Royce vehicles. This ornament is positioned centrally at the front of the car, above the grille. The car also boasts a long, straight roofline, a hallmark of classic luxury cars, which enhances its elegant appearance. The rear design includes a subtle chrome trim along the edges"
