They are integrated into the rear fascia seamlessly, with no visible external bulbs or intricate patterns, suggesting a smooth, polished finish.\n\nThe bumper is wide and robust, matching the vehicle's overall aesthetic. It features a matte black finish that contrasts with the silver body of the SUV. The bumper includes a subtle chrome accent running horizontally across the center, adding a touch of elegance. The lower part of the bumper has a slight lip, which enhances the vehicle's stance and provides a protective edge.\n\nThe taillights and bumper together contribute to the vehicle's sophisticated and commanding presence, distinguishing it from more utilitarian designs often seen in other SUV categories. The combination of the sleek taillight design and the sturdy bumper creates a balanced look that emphasizes both style and functionality."
