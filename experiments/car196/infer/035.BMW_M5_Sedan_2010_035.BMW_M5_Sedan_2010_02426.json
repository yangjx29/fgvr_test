The shape is rectangular, typical for many sedan models, and they are positioned horizontally along the rear of the vehicle. Each tail light appears to have a single, continuous lens, which is common in modern designs for simplicity and efficiency.\n\nThe size of the tail lights is proportionate to the overall dimensions of the car, neither too large nor too small, maintaining a balanced aesthetic. There are no visible patterns or textures within the lenses themselves; they appear uniform in color and design. The taillights are integrated seamlessly into the car's body, with no additional decorative elements around them, emphasizing a clean and minimalist look.\n\nA distinctive feature of these taillights is their placement and alignment with the car's rear bumper, which is slightly raised at the edges, giving a subtle sporty appearance. The dual exhaust pipes are located below the taillights, adding to the car's performance-oriented design. Overall, the taillights contribute to the car's sleek and sophisticated appearance while serving a functional purpose.",

The pipes have a polished appearance, reflecting light, which suggests they are likely made of stainless steel or a similar material. There are no visible special features or markings on the exhaust pipes, making them appear standard for this model of car.
