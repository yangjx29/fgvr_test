It has a smooth, glossy finish that reflects light, adding to the car's sophisticated appearance. The bumper includes integrated fog lights on each side, which are circular and located below the main headlights. These fog lights are smaller than the main headlights but maintain a similar angular shape, contributing to the car's cohesive design.\n\nThe overall design of the headlights and bumper is characterized by clean lines and a minimalist aesthetic, typical of luxury vehicles. The combination of the dark gray body, black grille, and glossy black bumper creates a striking contrast, emphasizing the car's premium status. The headlight design, with its sharp angles and clear lenses, adds to the vehicle's modern and sporty appeal.",
