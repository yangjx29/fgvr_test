The top light appears to be a clear lens, while the bottom one has a red tint, indicating brake lights. The tail lights have a clean, modern design with a smooth, glossy finish.\n\nThe rear badge for model year identification is located centrally at the back of the vehicle, just above the bumper. It is rectangular in shape and appears to be made of metal with a polished chrome finish. The badge likely displays the GMC logo and the model name \"Savana,\" though the exact text may not be fully visible due to the angle and distance of the photo. The badge is relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle but is prominently placed for visibility.\n\nThe vehicle's body is uniformly white, with no visible color variations or patterns.
