            "The badging area on the rear of the vehicle is located near the center of the trunk lid, just above the license plate. It is rectangular in shape and appears to be made of a metallic material with a reflective surface, giving it a polished look. The color of the badging is silver, which contrasts with the blue paint of the car.\n\nThe badging itself is relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle. It has a clean and simple design, with no intricate patterns or textures. The letters \"TOYOTA\" are clearly visible in a bold, sans-serif font, making them easily readable. There are no additional logos or emblems surrounding the text, which contributes to its minimalist appearance.\n\nThe badging's position and size make it distinct from other areas of the vehicle, such as the taillights or the rear bumper, which have different shapes and functions. The lack of any decorative elements around the badging further emphasizes its functional nature, distinguishing it from more ornate or decorative badging found on some luxury vehicles.",
            "The tail lights of the vehicle in the image are rectangular in shape, with a horizontal orientation. They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the rear bumper, spanning the width of the vehicle's back end. The color of the tail lights is primarily red, with a clear lens covering the bulbs. There is a subtle gradient effect where the red transitions into a lighter shade towards the bottom, possibly indicating a design element for aesthetic appeal.\n\nThe texture appears smooth and glossy, reflecting light, which suggests a plastic or glass material commonly used in automotive lighting. There are no visible patterns or additional designs within the tail lights themselves; they maintain a clean and simple appearance.\n\nThe size of the tail lights is proportionate to the overall size of the vehicle, neither too large nor too small, ensuring they are easily noticeable while not overwhelming the vehicle's design. There are no unique or distinctive features such as additional lights or reflectors integrated into the design, making them straightforward and functional.\n\nIn summary, the tail lights are characterized by their rectangular shape, red color, smooth texture, and lack of intricate designs, making them typical of many modern vehicles.",
            "The rear bumper and license plate area of the vehicle in the image is primarily dark gray, matching the overall color scheme of the car. The bumper has a smooth, matte finish with no visible texture or patterns. It is rectangular in shape, spanning horizontally across the width of the rear of the vehicle. The bumper appears to be standard in size for an SUV, providing adequate protection for the rear.\n\nA notable feature is the integrated taillight design, which is positioned above the bumper. The taillights have a red and white color scheme, with the red section being larger and more prominent, while the white section is smaller and located at the bottom. This design is typical for many modern vehicles, offering both functionality and aesthetic appeal.\n\nThe license plate is affixed to the lower center of the bumper, just above the rear bumper itself. It is rectangular and white with black lettering, adhering to standard license plate dimensions and placement. There are no additional unique features or special characteristics noted in this area, as it appears to be a standard setup for a vehicle of this type."
