The wheels are alloy with a multi-spoke design, featuring a silver finish that contrasts with the black paint of the car. The grille is prominent and includes the iconic BMW logo, with horizontal slats and a chrome surround that adds to the vehicle's luxurious aesthetic.\n\nOverall, the car's design emphasizes a blend of sportiness and elegance, with clean lines and a cohesive color scheme that makes it stand out.
