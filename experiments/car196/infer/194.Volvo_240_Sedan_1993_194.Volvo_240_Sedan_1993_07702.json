They are relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, which is characteristic of Volvo models from the 1980s. The grille is a prominent feature, occupying a significant portion of the front fascia, with a central emblem that is clearly visible.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the grille design, which includes a central emblem and horizontal slats.
