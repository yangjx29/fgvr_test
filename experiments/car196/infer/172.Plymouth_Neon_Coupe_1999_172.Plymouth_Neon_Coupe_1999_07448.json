The grille is a horizontal bar design, painted in a light teal color that matches the body of the car. It has a smooth, slightly curved shape that integrates seamlessly with the hood. The emblem, located centrally on the grille, is a small, circular logo with a stylized design, likely representing the Plymouth brand. The emblem's color appears to be a metallic silver or chrome, which contrasts subtly with the teal grille. The overall size of the grille is moderate, covering a significant portion of the front fascia but not extending too far into the corners of the vehicle.
