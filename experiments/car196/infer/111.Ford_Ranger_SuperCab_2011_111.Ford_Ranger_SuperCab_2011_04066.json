The wheels have a multi-spoke alloy design, enhancing both aesthetics and functionality. The side steps are integrated into the door, making it easier to enter and exit the vehicle.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The truck appears to be in good condition, suggesting it is either new or",

The badge itself has a simple design, likely featuring the Ford logo at the top, which is a key identifying feature for Ford vehicles. There are no visible patterns or additional text on the badge, making it a clean and straightforward emblem. The badge's size is relatively small compared to the overall dimensions of the tailgate, serving as a subtle yet distinct identifier for the vehicle."
