It features a subtle texture that appears slightly glossy, reflecting light and enhancing its three-dimensional appearance.\n\nThe Lamborghini badge is prominently displayed at the center of the grille. It is circular in shape and contains the iconic golden bull logo, which is a hallmark of the Lamborghini brand. The badge itself is metallic gold, contrasting sharply with the white grille. The golden color is reflective and shiny, making it stand out against the white background. The size of the badge is relatively small compared to the overall front grille area but is proportionate to the car's scale, ensuring it remains a focal point.\n\nUnique to this object, the combination of the white grille, the golden badge, and the overall design elements make it distinct from other luxury cars.

This color choice enhances the sporty aesthetic.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The wheels have a multi-spoke design, which is common in luxury and performance cars. The spokes are thin and smooth, contributing to a lightweight yet sturdy appearance. There are no visible patterns or textures on the surface of the wheels, maintaining a clean and polished look.\n- **Shape and Size**: The wheels are large in proportion to the car, which is characteristic of sports cars designed for both performance and style. They are likely alloy wheels, given their material and design, and they are positioned at the corners of the vehicle, maximizing aerodynamics.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The wheels feature a multi-piece construction, where each spoke is connected by a central hub. This design not only adds to the aesthetic appeal but also helps in balancing the weight distribution of the car.
