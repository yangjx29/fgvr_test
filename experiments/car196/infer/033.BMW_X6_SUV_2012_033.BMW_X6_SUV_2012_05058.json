The wheels feature multi-spoke alloy rims with a silver finish, adding to the car's sporty aesthetic.\n- **Shape and Size**: The X6 has a robust yet elegant silhouette typical of luxury SUVs. It is larger than a sedan but smaller than an SUV, offering a balance between practicality and style. The side profile displays a long hood, short overhangs, and a prominent rear end, characteristic of the X6 model.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The front grille is large and prominently displays the BMW logo, with horizontal slats that give it a modern look. The headlights are angular and integrated into the grille, contributing to the aggressive front stance. The side mirrors are body-colored, and the windows appear tinted, enhancing privacy and style. The rear features a dual exhaust system and a diffuser-like design at the bottom, emphasizing performance.\n-",

The plate has a reflective surface, which is typical for license plates to enhance visibility. There are no additional logos or unique designs on the plate itself; it is a standard issue plate. The plate's size is consistent with typical North American license plates, being smaller than the car's grille but larger than the headlight area.
