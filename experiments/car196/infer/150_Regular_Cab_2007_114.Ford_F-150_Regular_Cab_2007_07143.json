Here's a detailed description focusing on the side profile and door handles:\n\n### **Color, Texture, and Patterns:**\n- **Color:** The truck is predominantly white, which appears smooth and glossy, suggesting a well-maintained finish.\n- **Texture:** The surface looks clean and polished, with no visible scratches or blemishes.\n- **Patterns:** There are no distinct patterns; the body is uniformly white.\n\n### **Shape and Size Relative to the Object:**\n- **Door Handles:** The door handles are black and rectangular in shape, positioned centrally on each side of the doors. They are relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle but proportionate to the door size.\n- **Side Profile:** The truck has a classic pickup design with a short bed, a single cab, and a prominent front grille. The side mirrors are also black and integrated into the cab structure.\n\n### **Unique or Distinctive Features:**\n- **Grille:** The front grille is black with a horizontal bar design, featuring the Ford logo prominently displayed in the center.\n- **Tailgate:** The tailgate is white and appears to be a standard design for this model year.\n",

The surface appears smooth with a matte finish, typical of painted metal surfaces on vehicles. The tailgate is rectangular in shape, spanning the width of the truck bed, and is slightly raised at the top for easier access.\n\nThe rear emblem, located near the center of the tailgate, is a small, circular badge with the Ford logo prominently displayed in the center. The emblem is metallic and reflective, contrasting subtly against the white paint of the tailgate. It is relatively small compared to the tailgate itself, serving as a subtle yet distinct identifier of the vehicle's make and model. There are no visible variations or special characteristics on the tailgate beyond the standard design elements of a pickup truck."
