The headlights and side mirrors have a metallic finish, possibly chrome or a similar reflective material.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The grille has a textured, diamond-patterned design, which is characteristic of Chevrolet's styling. The bumper appears smooth and slightly raised at the edges for protection. The headlights have a clean, rectangular shape with clear lenses and amber turn signals integrated into the lower corners.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The van has a rectangular, elongated shape with a high roofline, indicating it is designed for cargo space rather than passenger comfort. The front end is broad and flat, with a prominent grille and large headlights. The side mirrors are mounted on the fenders, and the windows are large and rectangular, suggesting a focus on visibility and ventilation.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the Chevrolet emblem centered on the grille.
