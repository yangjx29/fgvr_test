The wheels are alloy with a multi-spoke design, which adds to the aesthetic appeal. The headlights are prominent and likely feature LED technology, as indicated by their sharp, angular shape.\n\n5. **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The car seems to be a luxury sedan, possibly an Audi model given the emblem on the grille (not visible in this image).
