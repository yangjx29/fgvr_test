The side profile shows a larger, more spacious cabin area, evident from the extended length of the passenger side.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The Crew Cab is characterized by its wider body, allowing for additional seating and cargo space. The door handles are integrated into the side panels, and the windows are large, providing ample visibility. The rear door is also visible, showing the full length of the cabin.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The truck features chrome accents around the grille, door handles, and window frames, adding a touch of elegance. The wheels have a multi-spoke design, contributing to the vehicle's robust appearance.\n\nThese features collectively confirm that the vehicle is indeed a Crew Cab, designed for both passenger comfort and utility.",
