The texture appears to be a honeycomb design, which is typical for high-performance Audi models.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The grille is large and prominently positioned at the front of the car, covering a significant portion of the front fascia. It is flanked by two large, angular headlights that are also black, contributing to the overall aggressive aesthetic.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The grille features the iconic Audi four-ring logo centered within the mesh. Below the grille, there are air intakes that enhance the car's aerodynamic profile and cooling efficiency. The headlights have a sharp, angular design with LED accents, adding to the modern and sporty appearance.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The car's license plate reads \"IN RS 2500,\" indicating its model and performance level. The overall design, including the grille, headlights, and air intakes, is optimized for both performance and style, making it stand out among other Audi models.\n\nThis combination of features—black grille with honeycomb texture",
