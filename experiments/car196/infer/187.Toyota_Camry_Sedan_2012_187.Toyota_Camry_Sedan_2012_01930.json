It features a horizontal grille element that spans across the center, which is characteristic of the Camry's styling. The grille is made of a shiny, metallic material that reflects light, adding to the car's polished appearance. Below the grille, there is a black plastic lower section that houses the fog lights, which are integrated into the bumper.
