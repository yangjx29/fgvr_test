It has a sleek, modern design typical of Hyundai vehicles.\n\nThe emblem, located at the center of the grille, is circular and features a stylized \"H\" in the middle, which is characteristic of Hyundai's logo. The emblem is also silver, matching the grille, and it is positioned prominently within the grille's frame. The emblem's size is relatively small compared to the overall size of the grille but is still noticeable and distinct against the background of the grille.\n\nThe combination of the silver grille with the circular emblem creates a cohesive and polished look, distinguishing this car from others in terms of its front-end styling. The emblem's placement and design are consistent with Hyundai's branding, making it easily identifiable as a Hyundai model.",

It has a slightly curved shape at the bottom, which is typical for many sedan designs. The bumper features a small, integrated fog light on each side, which is a common feature in modern vehicles. The lower part of the bumper includes a chrome accent strip that adds a touch of elegance and contrast to the otherwise monochromatic design.\n\nThe car's front grille is visible and is a horizontal bar design, which is characteristic of Hyundai models. The grille is also a light beige or silver color, blending seamlessly with the rest of the car's exterior. There are no unique or distinctive features on the headlights or bumper that set this car apart from other sedans in terms of design. However, the clean lines and simple yet elegant styling suggest it is a well-maintained and possibly older model Hyundai.",

They are proportionate to the car's size, neither too large nor too small.\n- **Unique Features**: There are no visible unique markings or designs on the handles; they are simple and functional.\n\n### Side Profile:\n- **Color**: The side panels are uniformly colored, with no visible patterns or stripes.\n- **Texture**: The surface appears smooth and unblemished, consistent with the rest of the car’s exterior.\n- **Shape and Size**: The car has a streamlined shape with a slightly curved roofline that slopes gently towards the rear.
