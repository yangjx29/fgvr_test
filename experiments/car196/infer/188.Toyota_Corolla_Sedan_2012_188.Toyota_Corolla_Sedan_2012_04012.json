They appear to be a combination of clear and amber sections, suggesting they may include both brake lights and turn signals.\n\nThe taillights have a smooth, glossy finish, indicating a likely plastic or glass material with a polished surface.

The bumper itself is a darker shade compared to the silver body of the car, creating a visual separation between the two elements.\n\nOverall, the rear end of this vehicle is characterized by clean lines, a cohesive design, and a focus on functionality while maintaining a stylish appearance. The absence of any intricate detailing or patterns keeps the design simple yet effective."
