They are circular in shape, typical of modern sports cars, and are positioned symmetrically on either side of the front bumper.\n- **Shape and Size**: The headlights are large and prominent, occupying a significant portion of the front fascia. They are designed to be aerodynamic, with a slight curve at the top to reduce drag.\n- **Unique Features**: The headlights feature LED daytime running lights integrated into the lower part of the headlight assembly, which is a common design element in high-performance vehicles for improved visibility and safety.\n\n### Front Bumper:\n- **Color**: The front bumper is black, providing a stark contrast to the blue body of the car.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The bumper has a matte finish, which helps in reducing glare and is often used for a sporty aesthetic.\n- **Shape and Size**: The front",
