However, based on the visible design elements, we can infer some characteristics:\n\n1. **Color**: The car appears to be silver, which is a common color for vehicles and does not provide specific details about the grille's color.\n\n2. **Texture and Patterns**: The rear of the car shows a smooth finish with no visible textures or patterns that would suggest a specific grille design. The taillights have a sleek, modern appearance with a clear lens covering them.\n\n3. **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The taillights are rectangular and positioned horizontally across the rear of the vehicle. They are relatively large compared to the overall size of the car, which is typical for SUVs like the Hyundai Santa Fe.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The taillights feature a dual-element design with red and clear sections, separated by a thin line. This design is characteristic of many modern SUVs and sedans, providing both functionality and style.\n\n5. **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The rear bumper includes a small, integrated license plate holder, which is standard for most vehicles. There are also two exhaust pipes visible, one on each side",

Here's a detailed breakdown focusing on the side profile and wheel design:\n\n### **Color, Texture, and Patterns:**\n- **Color:** The car is painted in a metallic silver finish, which reflects light and gives it a polished appearance.\n- **Texture:** The body appears smooth with a glossy finish, indicating a well-maintained surface.\n- **Patterns:** There are no visible patterns or designs on the body; it maintains a clean and minimalist look.\n\n### **Shape and Size Relative to the Object:**\n- **Shape:** The SUV has a boxy yet aerodynamic shape, characteristic of modern SUVs, with a slightly sloping rear end for improved visibility.\n- **Size:** The wheels are proportionate to the overall size of the vehicle, providing a balanced look. They appear to be standard-sized alloy wheels, common in mid-size SUVs.\n\n### **Unique or Distinctive Features:**\n- **Side Profile:** The side profile is marked by clean lines and a smooth transition between the roof and the rear. The windows are tinted, adding a touch of privacy and style.\n- **Wheels:** The wheels have a multi-spoke",

The brake light is positioned at the top of each rectangle, while the turn signal is below it. The lights have a smooth, glossy finish, reflecting light and giving them a polished appearance.\n\nThe rear badge, located centrally on the trunk lid, is rectangular and features the Hyundai logo prominently in the center. Below the logo, the word \"Santa Fe\" is written in a stylized font, indicating the model of the vehicle. The badge has a metallic finish, which contrasts subtly with the silver paint of the car. The badge's size is moderate, being large enough to be easily readable but not overly prominent compared to the overall size of the vehicle.\n\nThe combination of the rectangular tail lights, the central placement of the badge, and the metallic finish of both elements helps distinguish this vehicle from others in its category. The clean lines and modern design of these features contribute to the overall sleek and contemporary look of the Hyundai Santa Fe."
