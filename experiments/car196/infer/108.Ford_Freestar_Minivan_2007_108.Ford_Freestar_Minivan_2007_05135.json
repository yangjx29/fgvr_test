The text on the badge is in a dark color, likely black or dark gray, which contrasts with the silver background for readability.\n\nThe badge has a smooth texture without any visible patterns or embossing. The text on it is clear and legible, indicating the manufacturer and model of the vehicle. There are no additional unique or distinctive features such as logos or intricate designs on the badge itself; it is a standard, clean design meant for clear identification purposes.\n\nThis badge helps in distinguishing the vehicle as a specific make and model, which can be crucial for identification and maintenance purposes."
