The grille is painted in a matte black finish, which contrasts sharply with the vibrant lime green body of the vehicle. It has a large, open mesh pattern that allows for significant airflow, essential for cooling the engine and brakes during high-speed driving.\n\nThe badge on the grille is a small, circular emblem located near the center. It appears to be a metallic silver color, with a reflective surface that catches the light. The badge's size is relatively small compared to the overall grille area, making it a subtle yet distinct detail. The emblem itself is likely the manufacturer's logo, though the specific details of the logo are not clearly visible in this image.\n\nThe grille's shape is elongated and slightly curved, following the contours of the car's front end.

The surface appears smooth and reflective, indicating a polished finish. A black stripe runs along the side, adding a contrasting element to the bright green. The stripe includes the \"Savoyard\" branding, which is a unique feature of this particular model.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The car is positioned at an angle, emphasizing its dynamic movement. Its shape is characterized by sharp lines and curves, with a prominent front grille and angular headlights. The wheels are large and black, complementing the overall aggressive design. The car's size is substantial compared to the track, highlighting its performance-oriented nature.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the \"Savoyard\" branding on the side stripe, which is not commonly seen on standard models.

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The rear wing is painted in a matte black finish, which contrasts sharply with the bright green body of the car. This color choice helps it stand out visually and may also serve functional purposes such as reducing drag at high speeds.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The surface appears smooth and untextured, typical of high-performance sports cars where aerodynamics are paramount. There are no visible patterns or designs on the wing itself; it maintains a clean, minimalist aesthetic.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The rear wing is large and extends horizontally across the back of the car, spanning the width of the vehicle. Its shape is aerodynamic, with a slightly curved profile that helps direct airflow over the car's roof and around the rear tires. The wing is positioned low and wide, indicating its role in generating downforce and stability during high-speed cornering.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The rear wing has a sleek, integrated design that seamlessly blends into the overall silhouette of the car.
