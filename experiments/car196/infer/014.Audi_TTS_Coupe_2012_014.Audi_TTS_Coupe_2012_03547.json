The headlight is positioned at the front of the car, flanking the grille, which is a prominent feature of the Audi brand. The headlight's shape is elongated horizontally, fitting well within the overall aerodynamic profile of the vehicle.\n\nThe headlight is relatively large compared to the compact size of the car, emphasizing its importance as a functional yet stylish element. It features a single, continuous light strip that extends across the width of the headlight, contributing to a clean and minimalist aesthetic. There are no additional lights or indicators integrated into the main headlight assembly, maintaining a streamlined look.\n\nThe headlight's color appears to be a neutral white or off-white, designed to provide optimal illumination without any noticeable color distortion.
