Each spoke is evenly spaced, creating a symmetrical pattern that enhances the vehicle's modern aesthetic.\n\nThe wheels appear to be of medium size, proportionate to the overall dimensions of the car, which is a four-door sedan. The tires have a visible tread pattern, indicating they are likely in good condition. The rims have a polished look, reflecting light and adding to the car's luxurious appearance.\n\nThe car's body has a clean, uninterrupted line along the sides, emphasizing its streamlined shape.

The surface appears smooth and glossy, reflecting light subtly, indicating a polished finish.\n\nThe headlight is positioned at the front of the car, slightly angled towards the center, which is characteristic of BMW's design language. It is relatively large compared to the car's compact size, emphasizing its importance as a functional yet stylish element. There are no visible patterns or textures on the headlight itself; it maintains a clean and minimalist appearance.\n\nA distinctive feature of this headlight is the integrated daytime running light (DRL) located just below the main headlight assembly. This DRL is also black and blends into the headlight housing, contributing to the car's cohesive look. The headlight's design does not include any additional decorative elements like chrome accents, which further enhances its understated elegance.\n\nIn summary, the headlight's rectangular shape, smooth black finish, and integrated DRL make it a visually striking yet unobtrusive component of the BMW's front end, distinguishing it from other car brands with more orn"
