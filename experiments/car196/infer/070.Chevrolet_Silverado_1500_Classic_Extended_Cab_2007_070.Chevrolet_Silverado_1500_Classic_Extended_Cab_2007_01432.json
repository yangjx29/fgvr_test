This metallic finish reflects light, giving it a shiny appearance.\n- **Texture**: The surface of the badging has a smooth, polished texture typical of metal finishes used on vehicles for durability and aesthetic appeal.\n- **Shape and Size**: The badge is rectangular in shape and relatively small compared to the overall size of the truck. It is positioned horizontally along the side panel, slightly towards the rear of the vehicle.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The badge features the Chevrolet logo prominently in the center, which is a stylized \"C\" within a shield-like shape. The logo is surrounded by a thin, metallic border that matches the rest of the badge. There are no additional text or symbols on the badge, making it simple yet distinctive.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The badge does not have any visible wear or damage, indicating it is either new or well-maintained.

It is positioned at the rear of the truck, spanning the width of the bed.\n\nOn the tailgate, there is a badge located near the center-right side.

The text \"Z71\" is inscribed below the logo, indicating a specific trim level or package offered by Chevrolet.

This chrome strip is smooth and shiny, reflecting light and contributing to the overall aesthetic of the truck.
