It appears to be a single-piece design with a horizontal bar pattern, giving it a simple yet sturdy look. The grille's color matches the body of the car, which is a metallic silver.\n\nThe headlights are integrated into the grille area, positioned symmetrically on either side. They have a rectangular shape with a clear lens covering, typical of many SUVs from the early 2010s. There are no visible LED accents or additional decorative elements around the headlights, suggesting a straightforward and functional design.\n\nThe front grille and headlights together occupy a significant portion of the front fascia, making them easily identifiable as part of the vehicle's front end. The grille's size is moderate, neither overly large nor small, fitting well within the overall proportions of the SUV. The texture of the grille seems smooth and consistent with the rest of the vehicle's body, indicating a clean and polished finish.\n\nNo unique or distinctive features stand out in the grille or headlights, as they appear to be standard for vehicles of this era.
