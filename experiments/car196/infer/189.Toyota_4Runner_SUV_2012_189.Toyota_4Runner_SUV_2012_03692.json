The grille is rectangular in shape and spans across the width of the front bumper, taking up a significant portion of the front fascia. It has a subtle horizontal ribbed pattern that adds depth and texture to the surface.\n\nThe badge, located centrally within the grille, is circular in shape and appears to be a metallic emblem with a reflective surface. It is smaller in size compared to the overall grille area but stands out due to its polished appearance and contrast against the matte white background of the grille. The badge's design includes a logo or emblem that is not clearly visible in the image, but it is distinct enough to be noticeable as a separate element from the grille itself.\n\nThe combination of the textured grille and the reflective badge creates a balanced and modern aesthetic, distinguishing this vehicle from others in its category by emphasizing a clean and sophisticated look.",

They are rectangular in shape and positioned symmetrically on either side of the rear bumper. The design is simple and functional, without any intricate patterns or textures.\n\n- **Bumper**: The rear bumper is black and appears to be made of plastic. It has a smooth surface with no visible textures. The bumper extends slightly outward, providing some protection for the rear of the vehicle. There are no additional decorative elements or patterns on the bumper.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The taillights are the most distinctive feature due to their color and placement. The simplicity of the bumper and taillights suggests a focus on functionality rather than aesthetic appeal.\n\n- **Size Relative to Object**: The taillights are relatively small compared to the overall size of the vehicle, which is typical for SUVs. The bumper is proportionate to the rest of the vehicle, ensuring it does not appear out of place.\n\nThese elements collectively contribute to a straightforward and utilitarian appearance, characteristic of many SUV models."
