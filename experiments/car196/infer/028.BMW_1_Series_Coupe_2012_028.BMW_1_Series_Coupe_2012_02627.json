They have a circular shape with a clear lens covering, and they appear to be LED or xenon lights, as indicated by their bright white glow. The headlight housing is also chrome, matching the grille, and there are small, rectangular daytime running light (DRL) indicators located just below the main headlights.\n\nThe combination of the chrome grille, the integrated headlights, and the overall sleek design makes this BMW stand out from other vehicles in terms of its front-end styling. The clean lines and the use of reflective materials give it a premium and sporty appearance.",

The paint has a subtle sheen that catches the light, giving it a luxurious appearance.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The body of the car has a polished finish with no visible texture or patterns other than the natural reflections of light. The wheels, however, have a more intricate design.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The wheels are alloy and feature a multi-spoke design, which is relatively large compared to the overall size of the car. This design adds a sporty aesthetic to the vehicle.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n  - The wheels have a five-spoke pattern with a central hubcap that matches the car’s body color.\n  - The side mirrors are integrated into the door panels, which is a common feature in modern cars for aerodynamics and a sleek look.\n  - The car's body lines are smooth and flowing, typical of luxury vehicles, with a slight curve along the sides that enhances its elegant appearance.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The car's design includes a prominent front",
