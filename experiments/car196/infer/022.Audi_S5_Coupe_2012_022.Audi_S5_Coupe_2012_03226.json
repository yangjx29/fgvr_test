They feature a combination of red and clear sections, with the red portion forming the main light area and the clear section likely housing the brake light indicator. The lights have a smooth, glossy finish, reflecting light and giving them a polished appearance.\n\nThe rear badge is located centrally at the back of the car, just above the taillights. It is a small, rectangular badge with a silver outline and a black background. The badge contains the Audi logo, which is a four-ring emblem, and the model designation \"V6 T\" is written below it in a smaller font. The badge has a matte finish compared to the glossy tail lights, providing a subtle contrast in texture.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the car as an Audi model, specifically highlighting its V6 T designation, which indicates a V6 engine with turbocharging.
