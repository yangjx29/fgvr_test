They appear to be made of a high-gloss material, possibly acrylic or glass, which enhances their clarity and reflectivity.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The headlights are large and rectangular, typical of luxury vehicles like the Bentley. They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the front grille, contributing to the car's balanced and sophisticated look.\n   - **Unique Features**: The headlights feature integrated daytime running lights (DRLs) that are visible as thin, horizontal lines at the bottom of each headlight. These DRLs are a common feature in modern luxury cars, enhancing visibility during low-light conditions.\n\n2. **Front Bumper**:\n   - **Color**: The front bumper is black, matching the overall color scheme of the car.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The bumper has a smooth, glossy finish, consistent",
