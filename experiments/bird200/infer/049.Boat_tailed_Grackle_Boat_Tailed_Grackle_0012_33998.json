Its head is also predominantly black with a metallic sheen.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is robust and elongated, typical of grackles. Its wings are broad and slightly rounded at the tips, and its tail is short and square-cut. The head is relatively small compared to the body, with a pointed beak.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most noticeable feature is the bird's long, slender, and slightly curved beak, which is yellowish at the base and darkens towards the tip. This beak shape is characteristic of grackles and helps them forage effectively.\n\n4. **Distinctive Characteristics**: The bird's eyes are small and dark, and it has a slight crest on its head, though not very prominent.

The primary feathers (remiges) are long and extend beyond the tail when the bird is in flight. The wingtips are slightly pointed, giving the wings a more angular appearance compared to some other species like the American Robin.\n\n3. **Tail Shape**: The tail is relatively short and square-tipped, with a slight upward curve at the end. This is a characteristic feature of the Common Grackle, helping to distinguish it from other similar-sized birds such as the Purple Martin, which has a longer, more forked tail.\n\n4. **Unique Features**: The bird's beak is slender and slightly curved, which is typical for grackles.
