This white stripe contrasts sharply with the black plumage.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the black areas. The white stripe has a slightly lighter texture compared to the darker parts.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of grebes. The beak is long and slender, with a yellowish-orange coloration that extends into a slight curve at the tip.\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the white stripe on the head, which is unique among grebe species. The overall shape of the head and neck is rounded and compact, typical of diving birds.\n\nThese characteristics help distinguish the Western Grebe from other grebe species, such as the Clark's Grebe, which also has a white stripe but it is more extensive and less defined.",

The beak appears to be relatively short and stout, which is characteristic of diving birds like grebes. The yellow coloration is smooth and lacks any visible patterns or markings, making it a uniform shade across the length of the beak. The black tip is sharp and contrasts sharply with the yellow, creating a clear distinction between the two colors. This combination of a bright yellow base and a dark tip is unique and helps in identifying the bird as a Western Grebe (Aechmophorus occidentalis), which is known for this specific beak shape and coloration."
