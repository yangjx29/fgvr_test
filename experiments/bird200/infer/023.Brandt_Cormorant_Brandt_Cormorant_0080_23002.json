The wings exhibit subtle variations in coloration, with darker feathers near the body transitioning to lighter, almost grayish tones towards the tips, creating a mottled effect. This pattern is characteristic of many cormorant species.\n\nThe tail feathers are short and rounded, contributing to the streamlined shape typical of diving birds like cormorants. The overall size of the bird is medium, proportionate to the rock it perches on, suggesting it is an adult.\n\nDistinctive features include the bird's long, slender beak, which is slightly curved at the tip, aiding in catching fish. The eye is small and dark, set in a head that is relatively small compared to the body. The legs are short and robust, ending in webbed feet adapted for swimming.\n\nThese characteristics collectively help distinguish the bird as a cormorant, particularly one that frequents coastal or aquatic environments where such birds are commonly found.",

The beak appears smooth with no visible texture or patterns, suggesting it is relatively simple in structure. Its size is proportionate to the head, neither overly large nor small, fitting well within the bird's overall body frame. The beak's shape is slightly curved at the tip, which is characteristic of many seabirds, aiding in catching fish. There are no distinctive markings or variations on the beak; it maintains a consistent color and shape throughout. This beak shape and size are typical for birds adapted to diving and fishing, such as cormorants, which aligns with the bird's appearance and posture."
