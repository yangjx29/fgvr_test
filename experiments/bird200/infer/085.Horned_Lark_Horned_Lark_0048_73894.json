The underparts are white with some faint streaking, especially around the chest area. The feathers have a soft, slightly fluffy texture.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird is small to medium-sized, with a slender body and a short, pointed beak. Its wings are relatively long compared to its body, and the tail is short and square-cut.\n\n3. **Unique Features**:\n   - **Beak**: The beak is short and conical, adapted for seed-eating.\n   - **Eyes**: The eyes are dark and round, giving it a keen, alert appearance.\n   - **Legs and Feet**: The legs are short and strong, suitable for walking on the ground.\n\n4. **Distinctive Patterns**:\n   - **Wing Patterns**: The wings display a mix of light and dark bars, with the dark bars being more prominent near the tips.
