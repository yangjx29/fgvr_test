This red patch is a key identifying feature, as it contrasts sharply with the surrounding dark feathers.\n\n2. **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head appear smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light subtly. There is a subtle gradient where the black feathers transition into lighter shades towards the neck, creating a soft contrast.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, which is typical for many waterfowl species. The beak is short and pointed, suitable for feeding in aquatic environments.\n\n4. **Unique Features**: The red patch around the eye is particularly striking and unique. It is not present in all birds and can be used to distinguish this species from others. The overall shape of the head and the pattern of the feathers also contribute to its distinct appearance.\n\n5. **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The red patch is a consistent feature across individuals of this species, though there may be slight variations in the intensity and distribution of the red coloration.
