The dark grayish-black coloration of the head and body, along with the subtle sheen and lack of distinct markings, aligns closely with the Rusty Blackbird's appearance. The short, pointed beak and the overall body shape also match the typical features of a Rusty Blackbird. While the similarity scores suggest other species like the Gray Catbird could be close matches, the specific combination of coloration and texture in this image leans more towards the Rusty Blackbird. | Key Features: Dark grayish-black coloration, smooth and slightly glossy feathers, short pointed beak, and uniform dark body without distinct markings. | Uncertainty: The similarity scores to other species like the Gray Catbird are very close, indicating some overlap in visual characteristics. However, the specific combination of features such as the subtle sheen and the uniform dark coloration without distinct markings strongly supports the identification as a Rusty Blackbird.",
