Its wing pattern is characterized by:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The wings are primarily white with a subtle, speckled pattern of brownish spots. The texture seems smooth, typical of gulls, with no significant feather variation.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wing shape is broad and rounded at the tips, which is common among gulls. The size of the wing relative to the body is proportionate, consistent with the overall body size of an Ivory Gull.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the speckled pattern on the wings, which is not present on the rest of the body. This pattern helps to distinguish it from other gulls, such as the Snowy Owl, which has a more uniform white plumage without any spotting.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The speckling is relatively sparse and does not cover the entire wing. It is more concentrated towards the tips, giving the wing a slightly mottled appearance. This speckling is a key identifying characteristic of the Ivory Gull.\n\nOverall, the combination of the white body, the speckled wings, and the broad, rounded wingtips makes the",

The beak appears to be relatively short compared to the overall body size of the bird, which is consistent with many seabirds. It has a smooth texture without any visible patterns or markings. The beak's shape is typical for birds that feed on small prey, such as fish or insects, which aligns with the bird's white plumage and coastal setting. There are no unique or distinctive features on the beak itself; it is a standard, functional beak shape for its species.",

Its wings have a mottled pattern of brown spots and streaks against a white background, which is characteristic of Ivory Gulls. The texture seems smooth and soft.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird has a compact, rounded body typical of gulls, with a relatively short, thick bill. Its wings are broad and rounded at the tips, and it stands upright with a sturdy posture.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinguishing feature is the white plumage, which contrasts sharply with the darker, speckled wingtips. The bill is short and black, and the legs are dark, almost black, which is another key identifying trait.\n\n4. **Variations or Special Characteristics**: Ivory Gulls are known for their pale coloration, which can vary from pure white to a light grayish-white.
