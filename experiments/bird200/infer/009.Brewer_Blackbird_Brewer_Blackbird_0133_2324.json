Its body is compact and streamlined, typical of many blackbirds, with a relatively short neck and a robust build. The tail is long and slightly forked, a feature that distinguishes it from some other blackbirds like grackles.\n\n**Color, Texture, and Patterns:**\n- **Color:** The bird's feathers exhibit a deep, iridescent black with hints of blue and green, especially noticeable in the light. This iridescence gives the bird a glossy appearance.\n- **Texture:** The feathers appear smooth and well-groomed, contributing to the bird's sleek look.\n- **Patterns:** There are no distinct markings or patterns on the body; the entire plumage is uniformly dark, enhancing the bird's overall dark appearance.\n\n**Shape and Size:**\n- **Shape:** The bird has a robust yet slender body, with a slightly curved beak that is pointed at the tip. The wings are broad and rounded, and the tail is long and slightly forked.\n- **Size:** While the exact size cannot be determined without a reference, the bird appears to be medium-sized compared to other blackbirds,",

The feathers appear predominantly dark, almost black, with a subtle sheen that reflects light in various colors, giving them a metallic or glossy appearance. This iridescence is most pronounced on the upper parts of the body, where the feathers have a bluish-purple hue, while the lower parts seem more uniformly dark.\n\nThe texture of the feathers appears smooth and sleek, contributing to the overall glossy look. There are no distinct patterns visible on the feathers; instead, the iridescence creates a uniform, shimmering effect across the surface. The shape of the feathers is typical for a bird, with elongated and slightly pointed tips, especially noticeable on the tail feathers.\n\nThe bird's size relative to the object it is perched on (a piece of wood) suggests it is a medium-sized bird. Its head is relatively small compared to its body, with a pointed beak that is slightly curved upwards at the tip. The eyes are bright yellow with black pupils, adding a sharp contrast to the dark plumage.\n\nUnique features include the bird's overall sleek and streamlined form, which is characteristic of many passerine birds.
