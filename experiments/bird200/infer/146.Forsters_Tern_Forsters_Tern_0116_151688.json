Here's a breakdown of its key identifying features:\n\n1. **Head and Beak**:\n   - **Color**: The head is predominantly white with a small black cap that extends slightly onto the back of the neck. The eye area has a dark ring around it, which contrasts sharply with the white feathers.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The head has a smooth texture with no visible spots or streaks. The black cap is distinct and well-defined.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The beak is slender and pointed, typical of terns, and is black in color. It is relatively short compared to some other seabirds.\n\n2. **Body**:\n   - **Color**: The body is mostly white, including the underparts and wings. There is a slight hint of gray on the upper parts of the wings and tail, which becomes more noticeable as the bird ages.\n   - **Texture**: The feathers appear soft and smooth, with a slight sheen, especially on the wings and tail.\n\n3. **Legs and Feet**:\n   - **Color**: The legs are orange-brown, which is a characteristic feature of Sandwich T",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a tern, identifiable by its slender build, pointed beak, and white plumage with dark markings. The wingtips are dark gray, contrasting sharply with the white body. The texture of the feathers is smooth and fine, typical of terns, which helps them maintain buoyancy in water. The wingtips are relatively small compared to the overall body size, which is characteristic of many tern species. There are no visible patterns or markings on the wingtips themselves; they are uniformly dark gray. This uniformity in coloration can be useful for distinguishing terns from other seabirds with more varied wingtip patterns.",

There are no visible patterns or markings on the legs, making them appear uniform in color. The legs are slender and slightly bent at the knee, which is characteristic of birds adapted for walking on sandy or muddy surfaces. These features help distinguish the bird from other species with differently colored or patterned legs."
