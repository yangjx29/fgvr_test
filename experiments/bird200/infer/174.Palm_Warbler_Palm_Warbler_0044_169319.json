The head is marked with a bold black stripe extending from the eye through the back of the head, which contrasts sharply with the yellow coloration. The eye itself is dark and surrounded by a thin white ring.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird is small and compact, typical of warblers. Its body is slender, and it has a short, pointed beak which is slightly curved at the tip, suitable for probing into leaves and twigs for insects.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the black stripe on the head, which is a key identifier for this species. Additionally, the bird's plumage transitions from yellow on the underside to greenish-yellow on the upper parts, creating a vibrant contrast.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The Yellow-rumped Warbler can sometimes show a white wing patch visible when the bird is in flight, though this is not always present.

The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light, which is typical for warblers.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The wing feathers are long and pointed, tapering towards the tip, which is characteristic of many warbler species. The tail feathers are relatively short compared to some other warblers, but they are still prominent and contribute to the bird's overall shape.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The wing feathers have a distinct pattern where the yellow coloration is more concentrated near the body, gradually transitioning into a greenish hue towards the tips. This pattern is a key identifying feature of the Yellow-rumped Warbler.\n\n4. **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The bird's plumage shows a slight variation in shade across different parts of the wing, with brighter yellow near the body and a more subdued green at the tips. This variation helps in distinguishing it from other warbler species that might share similar coloration.\n\nThese features collectively help in identifying the bird as a",
