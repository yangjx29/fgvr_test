            "The neck area of the bird in the image displays a distinct white patch. This patch is relatively small compared to the overall body size of the bird. It has a smooth texture and appears to be a solid white color without any visible patterns or markings. The white patch contrasts sharply with the dark feathers surrounding it, making it a noticeable feature. The shape of the white patch is irregular, following the natural contours of the neck and not forming a perfect oval or circle. This unique combination of color and shape distinguishes it from other birds that might have similar coloration but lack the specific white patch on the neck.",
            "The beak of the bird in the image is robust and strong, characteristic of corvids like ravens. It is primarily black with a slightly lighter, almost grayish hue around the base near the nostrils. The texture appears smooth and glossy, reflecting light, which suggests it is healthy and well-maintained.\n\nIn terms of shape, the beak is straight and slightly curved at the tip, which is typical for birds that need to crack open hard objects such as nuts or seeds. Its size is proportionate to the body, being neither too large nor too small, indicating an adult bird. The beak's structure allows for efficient gripping and tearing, essential for its diet.\n\nThere are no visible patterns or markings on the beak itself; it is uniformly colored. However, the transition from the darker upper part to the lighter lower part near the base creates a subtle contrast. This coloration can serve as a visual cue for other birds, possibly aiding in social interactions or species recognition.\n\nNo special or unique features are apparent beyond its typical corvid characteristics. The beak's overall appearance is consistent with what one would expect from a raven or similar bird species.",
            "The bird in the image is predominantly black with a glossy, smooth texture. Its feathers appear dense and tightly packed, giving it a sleek appearance. The head has a mix of dark gray and black feathers, with a lighter, almost white patch around the neck area, which contrasts sharply with the darker plumage. The beak is short, robust, and slightly curved, typical of corvids like ravens. The eyes are dark and piercing, adding to the bird's intense gaze.\n\nThe body is robust and compact, with a broad chest and relatively short wings. The tail is short and square, characteristic of many corvid species. The legs are strong and dark, ending in sharp, curved claws that are well-adapted for perching and gripping. The overall size of the bird suggests it is a medium to large raptor, consistent with species like ravens or crows.\n\nUnique features include the contrast between the dark body and the lighter neck patch, as well as the overall robust build and the strong, curved beak. These characteristics help distinguish this bird from smaller corvids such as jays or magpies, which typically have more slender builds and differently shaped beaks."

        "structured_description": "### Detailed Description for Fine-Grained Classification\n\n#### Overall Appearance:\nThe bird in the image is a medium to large corvid, characterized by its robust build, glossy black feathers, and a distinctive white patch on the neck. The overall texture of the feathers is smooth and dense, contributing to a sleek appearance. The bird's posture is upright, and its strong, curved beak is prominently displayed, suggesting it is well-adapted for gripping and tearing food.\n\n#### Neck Area with the White Patch:\nThe neck area of the bird features a small, irregularly shaped white patch. This patch is smooth and solid white, contrasting sharply with the surrounding dark feathers. The white patch is not symmetrical and follows the natural contours of the neck, making it a distinctive feature. This unique combination of color and shape sets it apart from other corvids that may have similar coloration but lack this specific white patch.\n\n#### Beak Shape and Size:\nThe beak is robust and strong, typical of corvids like ravens. It is primarily black with a slightly lighter, almost grayish hue near the base. The beak is straight with a slight curve at the tip, ideal for cracking hard objects.
