Its beak is short and red, which contrasts sharply with the black head.\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap and white face, which is characteristic of terns. The red beak and legs are also notable and help in identification.\n\nThese features collectively make it possible to identify the bird as a Common Tern, distinguishing it from other similar seabirds like the Arctic Tern or Roseate Tern, which may have different coloration or patterns.",
