The patch is relatively small compared to the bird's head, occupying only a portion of the lower face. It has a distinct, slightly irregular shape that contrasts sharply with the surrounding feathers, which appear darker and more matte. There are no visible patterns within the patch itself; it is a solid, uniform color. This bright, vivid patch is a unique feature that helps distinguish this bird from others, as it is not common among many bird species. The contrast between the patch and the rest of the bird's plumage makes it stand out prominently.",

The yellow portion of the beak contrasts sharply with the black tip, creating a clear visual distinction. The texture of the beak seems smooth, typical of birds that spend much time in water, as it helps reduce drag when swimming.\n\nThe beak's size relative to the bird is moderate; it is neither overly large nor small for its body. This balance suggests it is well-adapted for both feeding and maneuvering in its aquatic environment. There are no visible patterns or additional colors on the beak, making the yellow and black a consistent feature throughout its length.\n\nThe beak's shape and coloration are unique and serve practical purposes, such as aiding in catching fish and other prey. The contrast between the yellow and black also makes it stand out against the bird's dark plumage and the rocky background, enhancing its visibility in its natural habitat.",

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has predominantly dark plumage, with a glossy black appearance on most of its body. Its head is adorned with a bright orange-red patch around the eyes, which contrasts sharply with the dark feathers. The neck area displays a lighter, almost white or light gray pattern, creating a striking contrast against the darker body.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear dense and slightly iridescent, especially noticeable on the head and neck. The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, typical of water birds like cormorants. There are no visible patterns other than the color gradients and the white markings on the neck.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a large, broad body with a relatively short neck. Its wings are broad and rounded, suitable for diving and swimming. The beak is long and slightly curved, adapted for catching fish. The overall size suggests it is a medium-sized bird, larger than a pigeon but smaller than an osprey.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bright orange-red patch around the eyes, which is unique to certain species of cormor"
