The texture of the head seems smooth, without visible feathers, giving it a sleek appearance.\n\nThe head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of many terns. The beak is proportionally long and narrow, further suggesting it might belong to a tern species. There are no visible patterns or markings on the head other than the dark patch mentioned.

There is a slight reddish hue visible at the base of the tail feathers, which is characteristic of some tern species.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, typical of birds in flight. There are no distinct patterns; the coloration is relatively uniform across the wingtips and tail feathers.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wingtips are sharp and pointed, extending beyond the main body of the bird. The tail feathers are also long and narrow, with a slight upward curve at the ends, contributing to the bird's streamlined appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The forked tail is a distinctive feature of terns, helping to distinguish them from other seabirds like gulls. The overall shape of the wings and tail is aerodynamic, optimized for flight over water.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The reddish base of the tail feathers is a notable variation that can help identify certain tern species.

Its wings have a slight reddish hue near the tips, which is a distinctive feature of some tern species.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the head and neck. The wingtips have a subtle iridescence, adding a touch of color variation.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The tern has a streamlined body with long, pointed wings and a forked tail. Its wingspan is relatively large compared to its body, enhancing its aerodynamic profile. The head is small and rounded, with a sharp, pointed beak suited for catching fish.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The tern's most distinguishing feature is its forked tail, which is clearly visible in the image. This characteristic is unique among many bird species and helps in identifying it as a tern.
