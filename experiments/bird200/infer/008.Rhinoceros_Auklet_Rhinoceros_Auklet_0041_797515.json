The beak is a bright orange-yellow with a black tip, adding a vivid contrast to the overall coloration.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, indicating a healthy bird. There are no visible patterns other than the natural variation in feather coloration.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is relatively short and stout compared to some other seabirds, with a slight curve at the tip. It is proportionate to the head, which is rounded and compact. The eye is small and dark, positioned near the base of the beak.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bright orange-yellow beak with a black tip, which is not common among many seabird species.

The feathers have a slightly glossy sheen, especially noticeable in the darker areas.\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear dense and slightly ruffled, typical of puffins, which helps them maintain buoyancy in water.\n- **Patterns**: The wing patterns are primarily dark with lighter streaks and spots, providing camouflage against the ocean backdrop. The edges of the feathers are not sharply defined, adding to the natural, rugged look.\n\n### Shape and Size:\n- **Shape**: The wings are broad and rounded, adapted for efficient flight and swimming.
