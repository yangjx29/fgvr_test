This white patch contrasts sharply with the dark brown coloration of the rest of the wing. The texture appears smooth and uniform across the wing, with no visible feather details that stand out distinctly. The shape of the wing is typical for a duck, broad and rounded at the tips. The size of the white patch is relatively small compared to the overall wing area, making it a noticeable but not overwhelming feature. There are no other significant variations or special characteristics in the wing pattern that are immediately apparent in this image.",

Its coloration is primarily dark gray, almost black, with a subtle sheen that suggests a smooth, slightly glossy texture. There are no prominent markings on the head itself, but the neck area transitions into a lighter shade, possibly white or light gray, creating a subtle contrast.\n\nThe beak is short and pointed, with a dark, almost black color, which is consistent with the overall dark tone of the head. The eye appears small and dark, blending seamlessly with the surrounding feathers. The head's size relative to the body is proportionate, neither disproportionately large nor small, fitting well within the bird's overall profile.\n\nNo unique or distinctive features stand out on the head; it appears relatively plain compared to some other seabird species. The lack of bright colors or intricate patterns makes it a more subdued and understated feature. This simplicity in head coloration and shape helps distinguish it from birds with more elaborate head markings or brighter plumage.",
