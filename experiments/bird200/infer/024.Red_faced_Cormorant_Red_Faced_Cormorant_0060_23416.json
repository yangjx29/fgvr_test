The patch is relatively small compared to the overall size of the bird's head, covering only a portion of the face. It has a distinct, circular shape with a slightly irregular outline, giving it a somewhat oval appearance. There are no visible patterns or additional colors within the patch itself; it is uniformly red. This vibrant red coloration stands out sharply against the dark plumage of the bird, making it a highly distinctive feature that helps to distinguish it from other birds. The red patch is a unique characteristic of certain species, such as the Black Cormorant, which this bird appears to resemble.",

Its size appears proportional to the bird's head, neither overly large nor small, suggesting it is well-adapted for its feeding habits. The beak's shape is slightly curved upwards at the tip, which could indicate it is adapted for catching fish or other aquatic prey. There are no visible variations or special characteristics on the beak itself; it is a solid, uniform color with a distinct black tip. This beak shape and coloration help distinguish the bird from other similar species, as many seabirds have more varied or differently colored beaks.",

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The bird is predominantly black with a glossy sheen, indicating wet feathers which are typical for cormorants. Its eyes are a striking red, adding a vivid contrast to the dark feathers. The beak is long and slender, with a pale yellowish-orange coloration at the base, which becomes darker towards the tip.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers have a smooth, almost velvety texture, especially noticeable around the neck area where they appear slightly ruffled. There is a small patch of white feathers visible near the tail, providing a subtle contrast against the otherwise dark body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a streamlined body shape, adapted for swimming, with a long neck and a relatively short tail. Its wings are broad and rounded, suitable for diving and maneuvering underwater. The overall size appears moderate, neither too large nor too small, fitting within the typical range of cormorants.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the red eye, which is quite prominent and helps in identifying the species.
