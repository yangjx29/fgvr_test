The most distinctive feature is the bright white patch on the neck, just above the chest, which is a key identifying characteristic of the White-necked Raven. The similarity score for 'White-necked Raven' is the highest among the candidates, further supporting this classification. The other categories do not exhibit the same combination of features, such as the white patch, which makes the White-necked Raven the most accurate match. | Key Features: The bright white patch on the neck, the glossy black plumage, and the robust body shape are the key visual features supporting the classification as a White-necked Raven. | Uncertainty: There are no significant uncertainty factors affecting the classification. The distinctive white patch and the overall body structure are clear indicators of the White-necked Raven.",

It is relatively small compared to the overall body size of the bird, but it is prominent enough to be easily noticeable.\n- **Unique Features**: The white patch is a unique feature that distinguishes this bird from others in its species.

It is primarily black in color, with a smooth texture and no visible patterns. The beak's size is proportionate to the bird's head, being neither overly large nor small for its body. Its shape is slightly flattened laterally, aiding in gripping and tearing food. There are no noticeable variations or special characteristics on the beak; it appears uniform in color and structure, which helps distinguish it as typical of a raven's beak rather than other birds.",

Its neck and throat feature a distinct white patch, creating a stark contrast against the dark plumage. The beak is robust and curved, primarily black with a slight yellowish tint at the base.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and well-groomed, with a slightly iridescent quality under certain lighting conditions. The white patch on the neck is smooth and lacks any visible pattern, providing a clean, sharp boundary between the black and white areas.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The raven's body is robust and compact, with a broad chest and relatively short legs. Its wings are broad and rounded, tapering towards the tips. The head is large in proportion to the body, with a strong, hooked beak suited for tearing prey. The overall size suggests it is an adult bird, as juveniles tend to have more rounded bodies and less defined coloration.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most striking feature is the white patch on the neck, which is unique to ravens among cor"
