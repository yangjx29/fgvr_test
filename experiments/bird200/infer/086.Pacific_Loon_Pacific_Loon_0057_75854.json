Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The loon has a predominantly dark brown body with a lighter, almost white, neck and head. The feathers on the head and neck appear smooth and slightly glossy, while the body feathers have a more textured, speckled appearance. The wings are darker, with a mottled pattern of brown and black, which helps in camouflage when the bird is on the water.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The loon's body is robust and streamlined for swimming, with a long, pointed beak that is slightly curved at the tip. The wings are broad and rounded, adapted for both flying and swimming. The overall size appears large compared to smaller birds, typical of loons.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most noticeable feature is the contrast between the dark brown body and the lighter head and neck. The eyes are small and dark, set close together, giving the bird an intense gaze. The beak is long and slightly hooked, ideal for catching fish.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: Loons are known for their ability to dive deep underwater to catch fish. Their wings are not only used for flying but",

The shape of the tail is broad and rounded, consistent with the design that helps these birds maneuver in water. The rump is also dark brown, blending seamlessly into the tail's coloration. There are no distinct markings or patterns on the tail or rump that set it apart from other loon species.
