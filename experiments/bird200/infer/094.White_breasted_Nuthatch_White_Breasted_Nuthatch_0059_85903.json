The gray is more prominent on the upper parts of the wings, while the white is visible on the lower edges and along the wingtips.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the wings appear soft and slightly ruffled, which is typical for nuthatches. There are distinct black and white bars across the wings, creating a patterned appearance. These bars are more pronounced towards the tips of the wings.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively short compared to the body length, which is characteristic of nuthatches. They are broad and rounded at the tips, aiding in their ability to cling to tree trunks and branches.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The wing patterns include a combination of gray, white, and black, with clear, horizontal bars.
