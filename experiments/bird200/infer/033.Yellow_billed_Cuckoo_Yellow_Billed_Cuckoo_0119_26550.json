Here's a detailed description focusing on the wing patterns and tail:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**: The bird has a predominantly grayish-brown back with darker streaks, which is typical for many cuckoo species. The underparts are lighter, with a creamy white coloration that contrasts with the darker upper parts. The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the head and neck.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is slender and elongated, characteristic of cuckoos. Its wings are relatively long and pointed, which is evident in the image as they extend beyond the tail when the bird is perched. The tail is short and square-shaped, another common feature among cuckoos.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bright yellow bill, which is clearly visible in the image. This is a key identifying trait of the Yellow-billed Cuckoo. Additionally, the bird's eyes are dark and round, and it has a small, sharp-looking beak that is adapted for catching insects.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The wing patterns show a mix of brown and gray",
