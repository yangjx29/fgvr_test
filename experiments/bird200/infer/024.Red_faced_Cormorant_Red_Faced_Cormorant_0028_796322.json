The tail is short and square, contributing to the bird's overall compact form.\n\nThe bird is perched on a moss-covered rock, which provides a natural and contrasting background. The moss adds green and brown tones to the scene, enhancing the contrast with the bird's dark feathers. The bird's size relative to the rock suggests it is a medium-sized bird, not overly large but substantial enough to stand out against the rocky backdrop.\n\nUnique features include the red spot on the beak and the overall dark coloration, which helps the bird blend into its aquatic and coastal habitats.

The feathers are predominantly black with a smooth, glossy texture, which is typical for cormorants. There are no visible markings or patterns on the feathers; they are uniformly dark, providing excellent camouflage against the rocky and mossy background.\n\nThe shape of the bird's body is streamlined, with a long, slender neck and a relatively short tail. The wings are broad and rounded, adapted for efficient flight over water. The beak is long, straight, and slightly curved at the tip, which is a distinctive feature of cormorants.

The legs and feet are not clearly visible in the image, but they are typically short and strong, adapted for swimming and standing on rocks.\n\nIn summary, the cormorant's uniform dark color, glossy feathers, streamlined body, and distinctive white beak with a red spot are key features that distinguish it from other birds."
