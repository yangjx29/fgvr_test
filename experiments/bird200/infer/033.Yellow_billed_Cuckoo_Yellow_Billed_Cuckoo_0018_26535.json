Here's a detailed description of its wing patterns:\n\n- **Color**: The wings are primarily grayish-brown with darker streaks and spots, creating a mottled appearance. The underwing is lighter, almost white, with dark bars and spots, which is more visible when the bird is in flight.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear soft and slightly ruffled, typical of a bird in a relaxed posture. The texture is smooth but not glossy, giving it a natural, earthy look.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wing patterns include a combination of solid and broken dark markings against a lighter background. These markings vary in size and shape, contributing to the overall camouflage effect. The wingtips have a distinct, darker banding pattern.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively long and broad compared to the body, which is characteristic of many cuckoo species. They extend well beyond the tail when the bird is perched.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Common Cuckoo has a distinctive yellow bill with a black tip, which is clearly visible in the image.
