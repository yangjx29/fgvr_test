The predominantly white plumage with subtle grayish tips on the wingtips and tail feathers, along with the bright orange beak with a black tip, are highly indicative of this species. The similarity score of 0.3393 for the Common Tern is the highest among the candidates, further supporting this classification. Additionally, the bird's posture and the overall body structure align well with the Common Tern's typical behavior during flight. | Key Features: Predominantly white plumage, subtle grayish tips on wingtips and tail feathers, bright orange beak with a black tip, and the bird's posture during flight. | Uncertainty: While the Common Tern is the top candidate, there is a slight margin between it and the second-highest similarity score.

            "The bird in the image has a predominantly white head with a small, dark patch around the eye, which is characteristic of many gull species. Its beak is long, slender, and slightly curved downward at the tip, a feature typical of terns. The beak is a bright orange color, which stands out against the white plumage. The texture appears smooth and glossy, suggesting it might be wettable, as is common for birds that spend time in water.\n\nThe head is relatively small compared to the body, which is consistent with the streamlined shape often seen in birds designed for efficient flight. The eye is dark and round, adding contrast to the lighter head. There are no visible patterns or markings other than the dark eye patch, which helps in distinguishing it from other gulls that may have more complex markings.\n\nThe beak's size and shape are distinct, being longer and more pointed than those of terns, which are typically smaller and more compact. This particular bird's beak also has a slight curve, which is a key feature for identifying it as a tern rather than a gull. The overall appearance, including the white plumage and the orange beak, is quite distinctive and helps in distinguishing it from other seabirds.",

The texture appears smooth, typical of a gull's plumage. The wings are outstretched, showcasing their broad shape and length, which is characteristic of seagulls. The tail feathers are long and slender, extending beyond the body, and they taper to a fine point. The overall size of the wingtips and tail feathers is proportional to the rest of the bird's body, maintaining balance in flight. There are no visible patterns other than the natural coloration, making the wingtips and tail feathers stand out as clean, elongated structures against the bird's body.",
            "The image shows a bird in flight, likely a type of tern, characterized by its slender build and long, pointed wings. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has predominantly white plumage with some darker markings near the wingtips and tail. Its beak is bright orange with a black tip, which is a distinctive feature. The legs appear to be dark, possibly black or very dark gray.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers have a smooth texture, typical of birds, with no visible speckling or mottling. The white feathers contrast sharply with the darker areas, creating a clean and striking appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is streamlined, with a long, narrow head and neck. Its wings are long and pointed, extending far beyond the tail when in flight. The tail is forked, with two long central feathers and shorter outer ones. The overall size appears moderate for a bird of prey or wading bird.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bright orange beak with a black tip, which is characteristic of many tern species.

The bright orange beak with a black tip is a distinctive feature, standing out against the white body.
