The feathers are soft and appear clean.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The head is rounded with a small, pointed beak that is yellowish-orange at the base, which is characteristic of Fulmars. The beak is relatively short and stout compared to some other seabirds.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most notable feature is the black band around the neck, which is a distinctive marking for Fulmars. This band contrasts sharply with the white plumage of the head and neck.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The Fulmar's eyes are dark and round, and they have a small, sharp hook at the tip of their beak. These features are consistent across individuals of this species.\n\nOverall, the combination of the white head and neck, the black neck band, and the yellowish-orange base of the beak are key identifiers for this bird.",
            "The bird in the image has distinct wing tips that are primarily gray with some darker streaks, indicating a textured appearance. These tips extend outward from the body, which is predominantly white, creating a contrast against the green grassy background. The wings appear broad and slightly rounded at the tips, suggesting a robust build typical of seabirds. The wingtips are not sharply pointed but rather have a more rounded, almost triangular shape when viewed from above. This shape, combined with the gray coloration, helps distinguish the bird from smaller, more slender birds like gulls, which typically have longer, more pointed wingtips. The overall size of the wings relative to the body suggests a medium-sized bird, possibly a type of fulmar or petrel, known for their large wingspans.",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), identifiable by several distinct features:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**: The Fulmar has a predominantly white underbelly and head, contrasting with darker grayish-blue upper parts. Its feathers have a slightly rough texture, typical of seabirds, which helps them retain warmth in cold climates.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The Fulmar is medium-sized, with a robust body and relatively short wings compared to many other seabirds. Its head is large and rounded, with a stout, hooked beak that is yellowish-orange at the base, which is characteristic of the species.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bird's hooked beak, which is used for gripping slippery prey like fish. The Fulmar also has a small, dark patch around the eye, which is visible in the image. Additionally, the bird's legs are short and set far back on the body, aiding in swimming and diving.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: Fulmars can vary in coloration depending on age and sex, but the overall pattern remains consistent. Juveniles often have more mottled plumage, while adults are more uniformly colored."
