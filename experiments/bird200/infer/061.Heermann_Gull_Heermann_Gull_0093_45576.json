The texture appears smooth, and there is a slight sheen, suggesting it might have a slightly oily or glossy surface typical of many seabirds. The beak is orange with a black tip, which is a distinctive feature. It is relatively short and stout compared to some other seabird species, and the shape is slightly curved, which is common for birds that feed by probing into sand or mud.\n\nThe head is small relative to the body, which is characteristic of many gull species. The eye is dark and round, surrounded by a thin white ring, which is a common feature among gulls. There are no visible patterns or markings on the head that would immediately distinguish it from other gull species, but the combination of coloration and beak shape can be used to narrow down the identification.",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a type of gull, characterized by its grayish body, white underparts, and distinctive wing patterns. Here's a detailed description focusing on the wing patterns:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**: The wings have a mix of gray and brown feathers. The gray feathers are more prominent on the upper parts of the wings, while the brown feathers are concentrated towards the tips and edges. The texture seems smooth with some subtle variations in shading.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and extend beyond the body when the bird is standing. They taper slightly towards the tips, which are dark brown. The wings appear proportionate to the bird's overall size, suggesting it is an adult.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The wingtips are darker than the rest of the wing, creating a contrast that helps define the shape of the wing. There are no visible markings or spots that stand out distinctly, but the gradient from gray to brown is noticeable.\n\n4. **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The wing patterns are consistent across the visible portion of the wings, indicating a uniform coloration pattern typical of many gull species. There are no additional markings or bands that would suggest a different species or subspecies",
            "The tail of the bird in the image is relatively short compared to its body length. It has a dark gray coloration with a slight hint of brownish tones near the tips of the feathers. The texture appears smooth, with individual feathers visible, giving it a slightly ruffled appearance. The tail's shape is somewhat rounded at the ends, with the outermost feathers slightly fanned out. This fan-like arrangement is a distinctive feature that helps in distinguishing the tail from other birds with more uniformly shaped tails. There are no significant variations or special characteristics noted in the tail; it maintains a consistent pattern throughout its length."

        "structured_description": "### Comprehensive Description for Fine-Grained Classification\n\n#### Overall Appearance:\nThe bird in the image is a medium-sized seabird with a slender build, standing on a sandy beach. Its plumage is primarily gray, with subtle variations in tone and texture. The bird's posture is upright, and its small, dark eyes are surrounded by a thin white ring, a common feature among gull species. The beak is orange with a black tip, and the legs are dark and slender.\n\n#### Head and Beak Area:\n- **Coloration**: The head is predominantly gray with faint darker gray or black streaking near the eye area, giving it a slightly mottled appearance.\n- **Texture**: The head appears smooth with a slight sheen, indicative of an oily or glossy surface typical of seabirds.\n- **Beak**: The beak is short and stout, slightly curved, and orange with a black tip. This shape is characteristic of gulls, aiding in probing into sand or mud for food.\n\n#### Wing Patterns:\n- **Color and Texture**: The wings display a mix of gray and brown feathers. The gray feathers dominate the upper parts, while the brown feathers are concentrated towards the tips and edges.\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are broad",
