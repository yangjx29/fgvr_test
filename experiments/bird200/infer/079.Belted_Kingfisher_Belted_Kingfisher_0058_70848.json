This is characteristic of the kingfisher's wing structure, which helps in flight stability and maneuverability.\n- **Underwing**: The underwing displays a more intricate pattern. It is predominantly white with black and gray markings. The black markings form distinct stripes and spots, creating a contrast against the white background. These patterns are not only visually striking but also serve as camouflage when the bird is perched near water, blending into the surroundings.\n\n### Additional Characteristics:\n- **Body Color**: The body is mostly white with a broad black band across the chest, known as the \"belt,\" which gives the species its common name. The head is black with a white stripe running through the eye, adding to the bird's unique appearance.\n- **Tail**: The tail is short and square, with a black base and white tips, which is another identifying feature of the Belted Kingfisher.\n\n### Size and Shape:\n- The",
