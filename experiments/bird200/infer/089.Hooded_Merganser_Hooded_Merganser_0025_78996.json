This crest is a key identifying feature of the Hooded Merganser.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head have a slightly glossy appearance, especially noticeable on the crest. There may be subtle streaking or barring on the neck, which can vary in intensity.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, with a short, pointed bill that is yellowish-orange with a black tip. The bill is slightly curved, which is characteristic of mergansers.\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the prominent crest, which is unique among mergansers.
