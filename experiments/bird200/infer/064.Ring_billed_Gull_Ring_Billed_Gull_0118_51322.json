The eye itself is dark and ringed by a thin white stripe, giving it a distinctive look.\n   - **Texture and Patterns**: The head has a smooth texture with no visible spots or streaks. The gray coloration is uniform across the head.\n   - **Shape and Size**: The beak is short and slightly curved at the tip, which is typical for gulls. It is yellow with a black band near the base, a feature that helps identify this species.\n\n2. **Body**:\n   - **Color**: The body is primarily white, with gray wings that have darker tips. This coloration is common among gulls and helps them blend into their coastal environments.\n   - **Texture**: The feathers appear soft and slightly fluffy, especially noticeable on the chest area.\n   - **Patterns**: There are no distinct markings or bands on the body; it is mostly plain white with gray wings.\n\n3. **",

The gray is more prominent towards the back, while the leading edge of the wing has a lighter, almost white appearance. The texture seems smooth with no visible downy feathers, typical of adult gulls.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and slightly rounded at the tips. They are proportionate to the body, which is typical for gulls. The wingtips are not sharply pointed as seen in some other gull species like the Herring Gull.\n\n3. **Unique Features**:\n   - **Ringed Bill**: The most distinctive feature is the ring around the base of the bill, which is clearly visible in this image. This is a key identifying characteristic of the Ring-billed Gull.\n   - **Eye Ring**: There is a faint, light-colored ring around the eye, which is another distinguishing feature.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: \n   - **Juvenile vs. Adult**: Juveniles often have a mottled brown plumage on",
