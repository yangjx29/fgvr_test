There is no visible variation in hue across these parts.\n\n2. **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light, which is typical of many songbirds. The texture seems consistent throughout the wings and tail, without any noticeable variations like spots or streaks.\n\n3. **Patterns**: The wings and tail lack distinct patterns; they are solid in color with no visible markings or stripes. This uniformity is characteristic of the summer tanager's plumage.\n\n4. **Shape and Size**: The wings are broad and rounded at the tips, which is a common shape for many songbirds. The tail is relatively short compared to some other species, ending in a slightly rounded tip. Both the wings and tail are proportionate to the bird's overall size, which is compact and robust.\n\n5. **Unique Features**: The summer tanager's wings and tail are notable for their vivid coloration, which is a key identifying feature.
