The neck and chest exhibit a subtle gradient, transitioning from darker tones near the head to lighter shades towards the belly.\n   - The feathers appear smooth and well-groomed, giving the bird a sleek appearance. There is a noticeable white patch around the eye, which is a distinctive feature of many auklets.\n\n2. **Shape and Size:**\n   - The body is small and rounded, typical of auks, with a robust build suited for diving and swimming. The wings are short and broad, designed for powerful flapping rather than gliding, which is evident from their thick, rounded shape.\n   - The head is small and rounded, with a short, stout beak that is slightly curved at the tip, ideal for catching fish underwater.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features:**\n   - The orange beak with a black tip stands out",

Auklets have webbed feet, which are adapted for swimming, but the webbing is not easily discernible in this image due to the water.\n\n3. **Color, Texture, and Patterns**:\n   - **Head and Neck**: The head and neck are dark, almost black, with a lighter patch around the eye area, which is a distinctive feature of many auklet species.\n   - **Body**: The body is predominantly dark, possibly black or very dark gray, with some lighter speckles or markings, particularly noticeable on the back and wings.\n   - **Beak**: The beak is orange with a black tip, which is a characteristic feature of auklets.\n\n4. **Shape and Size**:\n   - The bird appears relatively small compared to larger seabirds like seagulls.\n   - The overall shape is compact and streamlined, typical"
