Its legs are short and sturdy, also appearing dark, possibly black or a deep brown, and they are positioned firmly on the branch.\n\nThe bird's plumage is strikingly patterned. The head is predominantly black, with a glossy sheen suggesting a smooth texture. The chest displays a bright orange patch, which contrasts sharply with the black feathers around it. The wings appear to have a mix of black and white feathers, creating a subtle pattern. The tail is not fully visible, but it seems to match the black coloration of the head and back.\n\nThese features—dark beak, dark legs, black head, orange chest, and black wings—are characteristic of certain species, such as the American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla).
