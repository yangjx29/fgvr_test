The primary flight feathers have a dark base with white tips, creating a contrasting banding effect. The secondary feathers show a more intricate pattern with black and white stripes, giving them a textured appearance.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The wings are broad and rounded, typical of kingfishers, which helps in their aerodynamic flight.

The black and white coloration is not only visually striking but also serves as camouflage against both light and dark backgrounds, helping the bird blend into its environment.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The pattern on the wings is consistent across individuals of the same species, making it a reliable identifier.
