The neck and upper chest are a rich, dark brownish-black color.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head have a smooth texture with some fine, subtle streaking or barring, particularly noticeable on the nape and back of the head. The yellow coloration is vivid and uniform, without any significant variation in shade.\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is short and conical, typical of seed-eating birds, and is a light grayish-brown color. It is relatively small compared to the body size of the bird, which is consistent with the Yellow-headed Blackbird's build.\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bright yellow head, which contrasts sharply with the dark brownish-black body.
