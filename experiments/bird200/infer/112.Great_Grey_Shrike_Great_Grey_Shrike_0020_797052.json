The texture is smooth, and the feathers appear slightly ruffled, giving it a natural, undisturbed look.\n\n2. **Wing Patterns**: The wings have a light gray coloration with darker gray or black markings near the tips, which are characteristic of the Northern Shrike. These markings are not uniform but rather form a pattern that can vary slightly among individuals.\n\n3. **Tail Shape**: The tail is long and slightly forked, which is another key feature of the Northern Shrike. It is relatively straight and extends beyond the body, contributing to the bird's overall streamlined appearance.\n\n4. **Unique Features**: The Northern Shrike has a distinctive crest on its head, which is often raised when the bird is alert or agitated. This crest is not visible in the image provided, but it is a notable feature.\n\n5. **Size and Shape**: The bird is medium-sized, with a robust body and a relatively short, pointed beak.
