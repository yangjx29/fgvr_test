The overall coloration of the head is smooth and lacks any visible texture, indicating a sleek feather structure.

Its wings exhibit a distinctive pattern: the upper part of the wing is dark brown with a slightly lighter, almost grayish, band near the leading edge. This band is bordered by a thin white line, creating a subtle contrast. The lower part of the wing transitions into a lighter shade, blending into the white underbelly. The wingtips are black, adding to the overall contrast. The texture appears smooth and sleek, typical of a bird in flight or at rest. The swallow's head has a black cap, a white throat, and a reddish-brown patch around the eye, which is a characteristic feature of certain swallow species. The bird's beak is short and pointed, suitable for catching insects mid-flight. The overall size of the bird is small, consistent with typical swallow species.",
