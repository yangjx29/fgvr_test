Its head is rounded, and it has a small, pointed beak that appears open as if it is singing or calling. The eye is black and small, positioned near the top of the head, giving the bird a bright and alert appearance.\n\nThe texture of the feathers appears smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the head and breast. There are no distinct patterns or markings on the head, which contributes to its simplicity and uniform coloration. The eye is surrounded by a thin, dark ring, which contrasts with the bright yellow of the head, making it stand out.\n\nThe size of the head relative to the body is proportionate, with the head being smaller than the body but still prominent due to the bird's overall small stature. The eye is centrally located on the head, and there are no additional features like a crest or tuft of feathers that might be present in some bird species.\n\nOverall, the bird's head and eye region are characterized by their bright yellow color, smooth texture, and simple, unmarked appearance, which helps distinguish it from other birds with more complex plumage patterns.",

Its head, back, wings, and tail are a uniform bright yellow, with subtle hints of olive-green on the wings and tail feathers. The underparts are a slightly lighter shade of yellow, almost golden, which contrasts nicely with the darker areas.\n\nThe bird's beak is short and conical, typical of insectivorous birds, and it appears to be open, suggesting it might be singing or calling. The eyes are dark and round, giving the bird an alert expression. The legs and feet are a light brownish color, blending subtly with the branch it is perched on.\n\nIn terms of size, the Yellow Warbler is relatively small, with an average length of around 12-14 cm (4.7–5.5 inches). It has a compact body with a short, stout tail, which is characteristic of warblers. The wings are proportionally long for its body size, aiding in agile flight.\n\nThe texture of the feathers appears smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light and giving the bird a healthy, vibrant appearance.
