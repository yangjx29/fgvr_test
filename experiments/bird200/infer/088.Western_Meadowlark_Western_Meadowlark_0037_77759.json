The primary flight feathers (remiges) show a pattern of dark bars against a lighter background, which is typical for this species.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear soft and slightly ruffled, suggesting the bird might be in a natural, undisturbed state. The texture is consistent throughout the wing, with no significant variation in softness or stiffness.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wing pattern includes a combination of solid and streaked areas. The streaking is more pronounced towards the tips of the secondary feathers, creating a mottled effect. The primary feathers have a barred appearance, with dark bars alternating with lighter spaces.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and rounded, which is characteristic of many songbirds. They are proportionate to the body size of the bird, neither too long nor too short.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature of the Western Meadowlark's wing is the contrast between",
