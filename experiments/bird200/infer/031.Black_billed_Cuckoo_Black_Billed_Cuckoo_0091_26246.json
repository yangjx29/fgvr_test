The upper parts, including the wings and back, are a mix of grayish-brown with darker streaks and spots, giving it a mottled appearance. The tail is relatively short and rounded, with a dark tip.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a slender body with a long, slightly curved bill that is yellowish in color, which is a key identifying feature.
