The eye is dark and round, surrounded by a thin white ring, adding to the bird's distinct facial features.\n\nThe head is relatively small compared to the body, which is typical for many songbirds. The overall shape of the head is rounded at the top, tapering down to the beak. There are no visible patterns or markings on the head other than the subtle color gradients and the white ring around the eye. The texture appears smooth and fine, without any noticeable downy feathers or tufts.\n\nThis combination of features—gray head, dark beak, and smooth texture—helps distinguish this bird from others that might have similar coloration but different head shapes or textures.

The primary flight feathers (remiges) are dark gray with white edges, creating a distinct contrast. The secondary feathers (remora) also show a pattern of dark gray with white tips, which is more pronounced towards the outer edge of the wing.\n   - **Tail:** The tail is forked, meaning it splits into two long, narrow, and pointed segments. This is a key identifying feature for Tree Swallows.\n\n2. **Shape and Size Relative to the Object:**\n   - The wings are relatively long compared to the body, which is typical for swallows, allowing them to glide efficiently while flying.\n   - The tail is proportionally long and deeply forked, further aiding in maneuverability during flight.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features:**\n   - The white underparts contrast sharply with the darker upper parts, a common characteristic of many swallow species.\n   - The eye is dark and surrounded by a light ring, which helps",
