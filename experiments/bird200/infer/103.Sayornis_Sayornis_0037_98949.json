The beak is short and pointed, typical of insectivorous birds, and is a darker shade compared to the head, almost black. The size of the beak is proportionate to the head, neither overly large nor small. There are no unique markings or features on the beak itself; it is simple and functional. The overall shape of the head is rounded, with a slight indentation at the top, which is characteristic of many songbirds.

The texture seems smooth, typical of many passerine birds.\n   - The tail is relatively short and slightly rounded at the tip.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**:\n   - The wings are broad and rounded, which is characteristic of flycatchers, aiding in their ability to hover and catch insects mid-flight.\n   - The tail is short and square-cut, further distinguishing it from other songbirds like warblers or thrushes.\n\n3. **Unique Features**:\n   - The wing patterns include a combination of brown and gray, with darker bars across the wing feathers, creating a mottled appearance.\n   - The tail has a dark band near the base, which is a distinctive feature often seen in flycatchers.\n\n4. **Variations or Special Characteristics**:\n   - The bird's plumage shows a slight variation in coloration, with some areas appearing lighter or darker, which can be due to lighting",
