The head is proportionally large relative to the body, giving the bird an alert and attentive appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The black cap on the head is a notable feature, as it extends from the back of the head down to the nape. This cap is bordered by a thin white line, creating a distinct contrast against the tan background.

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The wing tips are a vibrant red, contrasting sharply with the rest of the wing, which is primarily a light beige or cream color. The tail feathers are also light beige, with a subtle hint of yellow at the very tip, adding a touch of brightness.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The wing tips have a smooth, glossy texture, which is typical for many bird species, especially those with brightly colored plumage. The red coloration appears uniform without any visible patterns, suggesting a solid coloration rather than a speckled or striped pattern.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wing tips are triangular in shape, tapering to a point, which is characteristic of many songbirds. They are relatively small compared to the overall body size of the bird, which is consistent with the proportions of a cedar waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum).\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The red wing tips are particularly distinctive and serve as a clear identifier for this species.

The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light softly, which enhances the vibrancy of the color. There is a distinct contrast between the yellow underbelly and the darker brownish-gray upper parts of the bird.\n\nThe shape of the underbelly is rounded and slightly puffed out, typical of many songbirds when perched. It occupies a significant portion of the bird's body, extending from the chest down to the belly. The size of the underbelly relative to the rest of the bird is moderate, neither overly large nor small, fitting well within the overall proportions of the Cedar Waxwing.\n\nA unique feature of this bird is the presence of red spots on the outer edges of the primary feathers, visible as small, bright red dots near the tips of the wings. These spots are not part of the underbelly but add a distinctive detail to the bird's appearance.\n\nNo other bird category shares these exact color, texture, and pattern combinations, making it easy to distinguish this Cedar Waxwing from others."
