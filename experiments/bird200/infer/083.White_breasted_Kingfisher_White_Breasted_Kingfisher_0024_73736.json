The throat is white, creating a striking contrast against the brown head. The back and wings display a rich blue coloration, which is more vivid near the tail.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and well-groomed, with a slight iridescence visible under certain light conditions. The white throat is clean and sharply defined, while the brown head has subtle streaking or barring, particularly around the neck.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is long, pointed, and slightly curved downward at the tip, which is characteristic of kingfishers. It is robust and strong, suitable for catching fish. The eye is dark and round, giving the bird an alert and focused appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the reddish-brown head, white throat, and blue back is distinctive and helps in distinguishing it from other kingfisher species.
