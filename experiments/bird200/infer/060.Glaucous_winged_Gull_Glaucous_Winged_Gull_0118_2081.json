Its head is small and rounded, with a short, dark beak that appears slightly curved at the tip. The beak is relatively short compared to the body size.\n\nThe bird in the background has darker plumage, appearing almost black, with a more robust build and a larger, orange beak with a black tip. This beak is longer and thicker than the one of the foreground bird, suggesting it might belong to a different species adapted for a different diet or habitat.\n\nBoth birds have smooth feathers, which reflect the water's surface, indicating they are wet.

The tail feathers are also white and extend outward, contributing to the bird's overall streamlined appearance.\n\n- **Color**: The primary color of the bird is a light gray, which contrasts with the white wing and tail feathers. The texture appears smooth, typical of many seabirds.\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and rounded, which is characteristic of birds adapted for swimming and diving. The tail feathers are short and stiff, aiding in steering and balance while in water.\n- **Unique Features**: The white wing and tail feathers stand out against the gray body, making them distinctive. The ruffled texture suggests the bird might be in motion or adjusting its feathers after a dive.\n- **Variations**: There are no visible markings or patterns on the wing and tail feathers, which simplifies their identification. The uniformity of the white coloration helps in distinguishing these features from other birds with more complex plumage patterns.\n\nThese characteristics are useful for identifying the bird as a species adapted for aquatic environments, such as gulls or terns, though without additional context, it's difficult to pinpoint the",

Its posture is upright, with its head held high, and it has a small, dark beak. The gull's body is relatively large compared to the other bird.\n\nThe second bird in the background seems to be an auklet, identifiable by its darker coloration, which includes a black head and back, and lighter underparts. It has a shorter, thicker beak, and its body is smaller and more compact than the gull's. The auklet's posture is more relaxed, with its head slightly lowered towards the water.\n\nKey distinguishing features include:\n- **Color and Texture**: The gull has a smooth, pale gray body with subtle variations in tone, while the auklet has a glossy, darker plumage.\n- **Shape and Size**: The gull is larger and more robust, with a broader wingspan, whereas the auklet is smaller and more streamlined.\n- **Unique Features**: The gull's white wingtips and the auklet's darker, more uniform coloration are notable differences.\n- **Posture**: The gull"
