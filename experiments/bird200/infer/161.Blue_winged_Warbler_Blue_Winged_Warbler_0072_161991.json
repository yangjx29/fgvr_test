The upper chest area transitions into a slightly darker shade of yellow, maintaining the smooth texture. There are no visible spots or additional markings on the head and upper chest, making the black eye stripe the most prominent feature.

The wing patterns of the Yellow Warbler are notable for their distinct coloration and texture:\n\n- **Color**: The wings have a mix of olive-green and yellow hues, with the green being more prominent towards the back and the yellow closer to the body. The wingtips are slightly darker, almost black, creating a subtle contrast.\n  \n- **Texture and Patterns**: The wing feathers exhibit a fine, slightly iridescent texture, especially noticeable under direct light. There is a distinct pattern where the olive-green and yellow colors blend, forming a mottled appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively short and broad compared to many other warbler species. They are proportionate to the bird's small size, which is typical for warblers.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black mask-like stripe across the eyes, which is a key characteristic of the Yellow Warbler. This stripe is sharp and well-defined, contrasting sharply with the bright yellow of the head.\n\n- **Variations**: While the overall coloration is consistent, there can be slight variations in intensity of the",
