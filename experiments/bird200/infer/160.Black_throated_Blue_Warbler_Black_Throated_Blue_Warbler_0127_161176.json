The tail feathers are primarily dark grayish-black, with a slight lighter shade at the base, creating a contrast against the white underparts.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially on the wings where the blue and black hues blend seamlessly. There is a subtle pattern of darker streaks or bars on the wings, adding depth to the plumage.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and rounded, typical of many songbirds, which helps in flight stability. The tail is short and square-cut, aiding in quick maneuverability.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the dark blue and black wing feathers with the white underparts creates a striking contrast.

The blue coloration is particularly striking, appearing as a glossy sheen on the nape and upper back. The feathers have a smooth texture, with some iridescence visible in the blue areas.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is relatively small, with a compact body and short, pointed wings. Its head is rounded, and it has a short, slightly curved beak typical of insectivorous birds. The tail is short and square-cut.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the combination of the white underparts and the contrasting blue and black upper parts.
