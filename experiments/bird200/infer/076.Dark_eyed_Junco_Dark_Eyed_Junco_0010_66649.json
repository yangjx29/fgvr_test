The primary feathers have a slightly darker edge, creating a subtle contrast against the lighter gray body. The wing bars, which are characteristic of the Dark-eyed Junco, are not prominently visible in this image due to the angle and lighting, but they are typically distinct and clearly defined.\n   - **Tail Feathers:** The tail is short and square-shaped, with a dark gray coloration. The edges of the tail feathers may show some subtle feathering details, giving them a slightly textured appearance.\n\n2. **Shape and Size Relative to the Object:**\n   - The bird's wings are proportionate to its body, with a moderate length that allows for efficient flight.

Its underparts are lighter, almost white, with faint streaks. The head is dark gray, contrasting sharply with the lighter body. The beak is short and conical, suitable for seed-eating, and appears to be a light brownish-gray color. The texture of the feathers looks soft and slightly fluffy, typical of many songbirds.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The bird is perched on a branch, and its size is relatively small compared to the branch it is resting on. The branch itself is thick and textured, with visible bark and some dead wood, which provides a natural backdrop that contrasts with the bird’s muted colors.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most noticeable feature is the dark eye stripe, which runs from the base of the bill through the eye and continues down the neck.
