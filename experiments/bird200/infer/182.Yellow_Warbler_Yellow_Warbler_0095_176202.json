There is a subtle hint of olive-green on the upper parts of the wings, which becomes more prominent towards the tips.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The wing feathers have a slightly textured appearance, with some fine, dark streaks or bars visible along the edges. These markings are not uniform but add a natural, slightly mottled look to the wing.\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively small compared to the body, typical of warblers. They are broad and rounded at the tips, which helps in flight and maneuverability.\n- **Unique Features**: The wingtips show a slight darkening, which is characteristic of the Yellow Warbler. This darkening is more pronounced near the tips of the primary feathers.\n- **Variations**: While the overall pattern is consistent, there can be slight variations in the intensity of the yellow and green tones among individuals. Some may appear more olive-green than others.\n\nThese wing patterns, combined with the bird's overall bright",

The undertail coverts are also yellow, blending seamlessly with the rest of the plumage.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers have a smooth texture with no visible patterns other than the uniform yellow coloration. There are subtle hints of darker streaks near the wingtips, which are characteristic of the Yellow Warbler.\n- **Shape and Size**: The tail is relatively short compared to some warblers, and it tapers to a point.
