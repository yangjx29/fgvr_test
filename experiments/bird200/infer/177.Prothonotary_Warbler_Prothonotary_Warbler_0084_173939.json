They are relatively small compared to the bird's overall size, which is typical for many songbirds. The legs have a smooth texture and seem to be slender, allowing the bird to perch securely on the branch.\n\nThe bird's eye is small and dark, providing a sharp contrast to the bright yellow plumage. There are no visible patterns or markings on the body other than the color gradient and the wing coloration. The overall shape of the bird is compact and rounded, with a small, pointed beak that is dark in color.\n\nThese features—color, texture, and shape—distinguish the bird from similar categories such as warblers or tanagers, which might have more varied coloration or different wing patterns.
