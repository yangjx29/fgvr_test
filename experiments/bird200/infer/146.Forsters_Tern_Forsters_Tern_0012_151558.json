The tail feathers are also dark gray, with a slight gradient towards the tips which appear slightly darker.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The wingtips have a smooth texture with subtle feather markings that create a slightly mottled appearance.

The tail feathers are long and slender, extending beyond the body, which is characteristic of many seabirds like terns.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The wingtips and tail feathers are relatively large in proportion to the bird's body, which is typical for terns. They are straight and taper to a fine point at the ends, enhancing the bird's aerodynamic profile.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The wingtips and tail feathers are consistent in coloration and shape across the bird, suggesting a uniform pattern typical of tern species.
