The feathers have a slightly rough texture, which is typical for fulmars, aiding in water resistance and insulation.\n\n2. **Wing Patterns**: The wings are broad and rounded, with a noticeable dark band running along the leading edge, which is a key identifying feature. This dark band contrasts with the lighter coloration of the rest of the wing, making it stand out.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively large compared to the body, which is characteristic of fulmars.

The legs are short and set far back on the body, which is typical for seabirds that spend much of their time swimming.\n\n5. **Special Characteristics**: Fulmars are known for their ability to remain at sea for extended periods without landing, often feeding on fish and other marine life.

            "The bird in the image appears to be a fulmar, identifiable by its robust body shape and size. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The fulmar has a predominantly grayish-brown plumage with darker, more sooty tones on its wings and back. Its underparts are lighter, almost white, which contrasts with the darker upper parts. The texture of the feathers looks slightly rough and dense, typical of seabirds adapted to cold climates.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The fulmar has a compact, robust body with a thick neck and a relatively short, stout beak. Its wings are broad and rounded, which is characteristic of birds that spend much time gliding over water. The overall size is medium, neither too large nor too small, fitting well within the range of seabirds.\n\n- **Unique Features**: One of the most distinctive features of the fulmar is its hooked beak, which is clearly visible in the image. This beak is used for catching fish and other prey. Additionally, the fulmar often has a white patch around its eye, though this may not be fully visible in this particular image.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: Fulmars are known for their ability to remain at sea for long periods without"
