Here's a breakdown of its specific features:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The bird has a predominantly light brown or tan coloration on its back and wings, with a slightly darker shade on its head and nape. Its underparts are lighter, almost white, which contrasts with the darker upper parts. The texture seems smooth and sleek, typical of birds adapted for flight.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is small and compact, with a long, slender beak that is slightly curved downward, characteristic of insectivorous birds. Its wings are pointed and extend far beyond the tail when at rest, aiding in flight efficiency.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the forked tail, which is a key identifier for swallows. This tail shape helps with maneuverability during flight. The beak is also notable for its thinness and slight curve, which is ideal for catching insects mid-air.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: Swallows can vary in color depending on the species, but this one exhibits a common pattern seen in many swallow species. The forked tail is a consistent feature across different swallow",
