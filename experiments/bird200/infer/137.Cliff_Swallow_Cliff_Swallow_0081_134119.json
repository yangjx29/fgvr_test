Its beak is short and pointed, typical of insectivorous birds, and appears to be a light tan color with a darker tip. The body feathers are a mix of dark brown and lighter shades, creating a mottled appearance. The tail is short and squared off, another feature common among swallows.

Here’s a breakdown of the wing pattern:\n\n- **Color**: The wings have a dark blue-gray coloration with a slight iridescence, especially noticeable under certain light conditions. The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers look fine and densely packed, giving the wings a compact appearance. There is no significant variation in texture across the wing surfaces.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wing pattern includes a subtle gradient from darker at the tips to lighter near the body. There are no distinct markings or spots, which is typical for young barn swallows. The leading edge of the wing shows a slight curve, characteristic of the species.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively long compared to the body, which is a key feature of barn swallows. They taper towards the tip, and the primary feathers are pointed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The wingtips are slightly rounded, and there is a noticeable gap between the primary feathers, which is a common feature in young birds. The wing pattern lacks the more complex markings seen in adult barn swallows.\n\n- **Variations**: Young barn swallows often have",

The feathers have a slightly glossy texture, especially noticeable on the back and wings. The head is dark with a pale, almost yellowish throat and a small, pointed beak.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is slender and streamlined, typical of swallows, with a long, forked tail that is characteristic of the species.
