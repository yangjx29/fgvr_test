There is a small patch of yellow on the back of the head, adding a touch of color contrast.\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, typical of woodpeckers, which helps them adhere to tree bark.\n- **Patterns**: The white stripe through the eye is sharp and well-defined, extending from the beak across the eye and continuing down the neck. This pattern is a key identifying feature for this species.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of woodpeckers. The beak is short and pointed, adapted for pecking into wood.\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the black head, white stripe, and yellow patch is unique to this species.

The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of woodpecker plumage.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wing patterns include a combination of dark and light bands, creating a striped effect. The primary wing feathers (remiges) have a darker base with lighter tips, while the secondary feathers (remenisci) show more variation in color and pattern. The wingtips are darker, almost black, contrasting sharply with the lighter areas.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is compact and streamlined, adapted for climbing trees. Its wings are relatively short compared to its body length, which is characteristic of woodpeckers. The tail is stiff and broad, aiding in balance and support when clinging to tree trunks.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The woodpecker has a distinctive black cap on its head, which contrasts sharply with the white stripe running through the eye and the yellow stripe above it.
