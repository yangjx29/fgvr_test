The throat is black, which gives it the \"Black-throated\" part of its name. The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, typical of warblers.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird is small, with a compact body and short, pointed beak. Its head is rounded, and the tail is relatively short compared to other warblers.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the black throat patch, which contrasts sharply with the white underparts. The eye is dark, and the beak is slender and pointed, suitable for catching insects.\n\n4. **Special Characteristics**: The bird's posture suggests it might be vocalizing or calling out, as its beak is slightly open.
