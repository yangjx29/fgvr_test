The body is medium-sized, with a robust build suitable for wading and foraging.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The bird's eye is dark and round, surrounded by a thin ring of white feathers, which is common among gulls. The legs are pinkish-gray, and the feet are webbed, aiding in swimming and walking on slippery surfaces.\n\n4. **Special Characteristics**: The bird is perched on what looks like a weathered piece of wood or metal, possibly part of a dock or pier.
