The eye is dark and surrounded by a thin white ring, which is characteristic of this species.\n   - **Texture and Patterns:** The feathers on the head have a slightly ruffled appearance, giving it a crest-like look, though not as prominent as in some other flycatchers.\n   - **Shape and Size:** The beak is short and slightly curved downward, typical of insectivorous birds. It is relatively small compared to the body size.\n\n2. **Body and Tail:**\n   - **Color:** The underparts are white, contrasting sharply with the grayish-brown back and wings.\n   - **Texture and Patterns:** The wings have a distinct pattern with a black band across the upper wing and a white patch near the bend of the wing.\n   - **Tail:** The tail is long and forked, with a central stripe of white feathers.\n\n3. **Unique Features:**\n   - The combination of the light grayish",

The underparts are white, contrasting sharply with the darker upper parts. The tail is long and forked, with a mix of brown and white bands.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is robust, with a short, thick bill typical of flycatchers. Its wings are broad and rounded, and the tail is notably long and deeply forked, which is characteristic of the species.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the long, forked tail, which is clearly visible in the image. This is a key identifier for the Great Crested Flycatcher. Additionally, the bird's overall shape and proportions, including the relatively short neck and sturdy build, are consistent with the species.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The coloration can vary slightly among individuals, with some showing more pronounced streaking on the chest and others appearing more uniformly white below.
