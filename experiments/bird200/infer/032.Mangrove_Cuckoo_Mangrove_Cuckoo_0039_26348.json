It tapers towards the tip, maintaining a consistent width throughout most of its length.\n- **Unique Features**: The white-tipped black feathers are a defining feature that sets this bird apart from others.

The feathers have a smooth texture, and there's a slight sheen, suggesting a healthy plumage. The neck and chest display a soft, creamy white coloration, which contrasts with the darker gray of the head.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is long, slender, and slightly curved downward at the tip, characteristic of cuckoos. It is relatively short compared to some other bird species but still elongated enough for its purpose. The head is small in proportion to the body, typical of cuckoos, which often have a compact head and a longer tail.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the tail, which is long and has a distinctive pattern of black and white spots or bars. This pattern is quite unique and helps in distinguishing cuckoos from other birds.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The tail's pattern is particularly variable among cuckoo species, with some having more pronounced spots than others.

Its head is grayish with a darker, more intense gray cap, and it has a yellow-orange beak that curves slightly downward at the tip.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The tail feathers are particularly striking, featuring a series of large, white spots against a dark background, creating a polka-dot effect. The rest of the plumage appears smooth and relatively uniform in texture.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a slender body with a long, straight tail that extends beyond the branch it is perched on.
