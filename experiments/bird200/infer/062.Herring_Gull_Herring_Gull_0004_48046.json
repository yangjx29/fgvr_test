They have a smooth texture and are relatively broad compared to the wings, which is typical for many seabirds like gulls. The tips of the tail feathers are slightly darker, almost black, creating a subtle contrast against the white base. This coloration pattern helps in distinguishing the tail from other similar birds, as it is a characteristic feature often used in identification. The overall shape is broad and rounded, which aids in the bird's aerodynamics during flight.",

The beak appears robust and slightly curved, typical for birds that feed on fish and other aquatic prey. Its size is proportional to the body, indicating it is well-adapted for its feeding habits. The texture seems smooth, and there are no visible patterns or markings on the beak itself. The beak's coloration and shape are distinct and serve as key identifiers for distinguishing this bird from others, such as terns or cormorants, which have differently shaped or colored beaks."
