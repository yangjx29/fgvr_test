Here's a detailed description of its wing patterns and tail feathers:\n\n- **Color**: The wings are primarily gray with darker gray or blackish tips, creating a subtle contrast. The tail feathers are dark gray with a slight sheen, appearing slightly darker at the tips.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the tail feathers which have a more pronounced sheen.\n\n- **Patterns**: There is a distinct dark band across the upper part of the wing, which is a characteristic feature of many tern species. This band is more prominent near the shoulder area and fades towards the wingtip.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are long and narrow, tapering to a point, which is typical for terns. They extend beyond the length of the tail when the bird is perched.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The bird's head has a black cap that extends down the back of the neck, contrasting sharply with the white underparts. The legs are orange, adding another distinguishing feature.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The bird's overall plumage is relatively uniform, with no significant variation in",

Its head features a black cap, which contrasts sharply with the lighter coloration of the rest of its body. The beak is short and pointed, with a dark tip and a light-colored base, suggesting it is adapted for catching small fish. The legs are orange-red, adding a vibrant touch against the muted tones of the bird's plumage.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The bird appears relatively small compared to the buoy it is perched on. The buoy is cylindrical and rounded at the top, with a slightly worn, off-white surface that shows signs of weathering and exposure to the elements. The buoy's size dwarfs the bird, emphasizing its small stature.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The bird's posture is alert and upright, with its wings folded neatly along its body.
