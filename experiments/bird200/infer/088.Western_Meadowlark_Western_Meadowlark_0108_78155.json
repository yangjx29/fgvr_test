The yellow feathers are more prominent near the body, while the brown feathers are more extensive towards the tips of the wings.\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear soft and slightly glossy, typical of many songbirds.\n- **Patterns**: There is a noticeable pattern where the yellow and brown feathers intermingle, creating a mottled effect. This pattern is consistent across the wings, with no distinct stripes or spots.\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and rounded, which is characteristic of meadowlarks. They are not as long or pointed as those of some other songbirds like sparrows.\n\n### Unique Features:\n- **Beak**: The beak is short and conical, adapted for seed-eating.\n- **Legs and Feet**: The legs are thin and light-colored, suitable for walking on grassy terrain.\n- **Tail**: The tail is short and square-tipped, aiding in balance when perched or flying.\n\n### Variations and Special Characteristics:\n- **Sexual Dimorphism**:",

They appear to be dark brown with subtle lighter streaks or markings, giving them a slightly mottled appearance. The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, which is typical for many bird species. The shape is broad and fan-like when the bird is at rest, with the tips pointing downward. This fan-like shape helps in stabilizing the bird during flight and while walking. There are no particularly distinctive features such as spots or bars that stand out; the overall pattern is more uniform across the feathers.
