This patch is often referred to as an \"eyebrow\" marking. The beak is robust and conical, typical of seed-eating birds, and is primarily grayish-white with a darker tip.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head have a slightly glossy appearance, especially noticeable on the yellow patch. The texture of the feathers is soft and fluffy, which is characteristic of many finch species.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is thick and strong, suitable for cracking seeds. It is relatively short compared to some other finches but still substantial in size. The head is rounded, and the overall body shape is plump and robust.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the yellow eyebrow stripe, dark brown head, and robust beak are key identifying features.
