A notable feature is the white stripe running along the upper edge of the beak, adding a unique contrast against the darker tones of the bird's head.

This stripe is bordered by darker feathers, creating a contrast that highlights the eye.\n\nThe eye itself is relatively small compared to the overall size of the head, but it is prominent due to its bright coloration and the stark white stripe around it. The texture appears smooth, typical of avian eyes, and there are no visible signs of feathering or other markings that would obscure the eye.\n\nThis combination of a light-colored iris, a thin white stripe, and the dark bordering feathers is distinctive and helps in distinguishing this bird from others with similar plumage patterns.

Its beak is bright orange-red, contrasting sharply with the darker plumage. The neck and upper chest display a mix of dark and light gray feathers, creating a mottled pattern.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear soft and slightly fluffy, typical of seabirds. The head has a smooth texture, while the neck and chest have a more textured appearance due to the interwoven feather patterns.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: While the image focuses on the head and neck, the overall body shape suggests a compact and rounded form, characteristic of the Auklet family. The size appears relatively small compared to larger birds like seagulls.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bright orange-red beak, which is a key identifier for the Enormous Auklet.
