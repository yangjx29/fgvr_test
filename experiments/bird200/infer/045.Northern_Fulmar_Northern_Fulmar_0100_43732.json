            "The bird in the image appears to be a Fulmar, identifiable by its distinctive wing patterns and coloration. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The Fulmar has a predominantly white underbelly and head, contrasting with its grayish-brown upperparts. The wings exhibit a mottled pattern of darker and lighter shades, creating a textured appearance. The tail is short and rounded, blending into the overall body shape.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear slightly rough and scaly, typical of seabirds, which helps them retain warmth and reduce water absorption when they dive into cold ocean waters.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are broad and rounded, extending far beyond the body, which is characteristic of seabirds adapted for gliding over long distances. The body is robust and compact, suited for diving and swimming in the ocean.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Fulmar's beak is short and thick, with a slight curve at the tip, which is well-adapted for catching fish and other prey. Its eyes are dark and piercing, aiding in navigation and hunting.\n\n- **Variations**: The Fulmar can vary in color intensity depending on age and sex, with younger birds often having more muted colors compared to adults.

Its wings are broad and slightly rounded at the tips, which are characteristic of seabirds adapted for gliding over water. The overall size is medium to large compared to smaller shorebirds.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Fulmar's most distinctive feature is its hooked bill, which is visible in the image. This bill is yellowish-orange and slightly curved, aiding in catching fish and other prey. The legs are short and set far back on the body, which is typical for birds that spend much of their time swimming and diving.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: Fulmars can vary in color intensity depending on age and sex.
