The wing edges have a subtle white or light brown edging.\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, typical of many thrush species.\n- **Patterns**: The wing has prominent black streaks that run parallel to each other, creating a striped effect. These stripes are bordered by lighter brown or tan areas, giving the wing a banded appearance.\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and rounded, which is common among thrushes. They are proportionate to the body size, which is compact and streamlined.\n- **Unique Features**: The wing patterns are quite distinctive and serve as a key identifier for thrushes.
