This white stripe contrasts sharply with the dark plumage.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head and neck are smooth and appear slightly glossy, especially noticeable in the white stripe area. The texture is fine and compact, typical of grebes.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of grebes. The neck is short and thick, allowing for efficient maneuvering underwater.\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bright orange-red eye, which stands out vividly against the dark head. The bill is short and pointed, adapted for catching fish and other aquatic prey.\n- **Special Characteristics**: The Black-necked Grebe has a unique crest that can be raised when the bird is agitated or alarmed.
