The beak is short and pointed, with a light grayish hue, and the texture appears smooth.\n\nThe head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of many warbler species. The overall coloration of the head is vibrant and uniform, with no visible patterns other than the dark stripe through the eye.

The edges of the wing feathers have a slightly darker, almost blackish hue, creating a contrast against the olive-green.\n- **Tail Feathers:** The tail is short and square-shaped, with a dark brown coloration that matches the back and wings. There are no distinct markings or patterns on the tail feathers.\n\n### Visual Characteristics:\n- **Body Color:** The body is predominantly yellow, especially around the throat and belly, which gives it its name \"Yellow-throated Warbler.\" The yellow coloration is bright and uniform, without any significant variation.\n- **Head Color:** The head has a mix of yellow and olive-green, with a darker olive-green cap that extends down the back of the neck. The eye area is a darker shade, almost black, which contrasts sharply with the yellow.\n- **Beak:** The beak is small, pointed, and slightly curved, typical of insectivorous birds like",

It has a smooth texture without any visible patterns or markings. The beak's coloration is consistent throughout, with no variation in hue or texture. This beak shape and size are characteristic of many warbler species, particularly those found in North America, such as the Yellow-throated Warbler (Setophaga dominica), which matches the bird in the image.
