Its back and wings display a mix of dark and light gray feathers, creating a mottled pattern. The underparts are lighter, almost white, contrasting with the darker upper parts.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is compact and rounded, typical of junco species.

The beak is relatively small compared to some other songbirds.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most distinguishing feature is the dark eye, which gives the bird its common name \"Dark-eyed Junco.\" This dark eye is surrounded by a lighter ring, making it stand out against the darker head.\n\n4. **Special Characteristics**: The legs and feet are a pale yellowish-brown color, which can vary slightly among individuals.
