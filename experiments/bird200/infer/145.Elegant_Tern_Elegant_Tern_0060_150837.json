            "The bird in the image appears to be a Common Tern (Sterna hirundo). Here's a detailed description focusing on the head and beak area:\n\n- **Color**: The head is predominantly white with a small black cap that extends slightly over the eyes. The beak is long, slender, and pointed, with a bright orange-red coloration that contrasts sharply with the white head.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The head has smooth feathers with no visible patterns other than the black cap. The beak is smooth and glossy, reflecting light, which enhances its vibrant color.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is elongated and slightly curved at the tip, typical of terns. It is proportionally large compared to the head, which is characteristic of this species. The head itself is relatively small in comparison to the body, consistent with the streamlined shape of terns.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the white head with a black cap and the bright orange-red beak is distinctive and helps identify it as a Common Tern. There are no other tern species that share these exact color patterns.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The Common Tern's beak color can vary slightly, sometimes appearing more yellowish or less intense,",
            "The wingtips of the bird in the image are black with white tips, creating a distinct contrast. The texture appears smooth, typical of many seabirds, and there is no visible pattern other than the color gradient. The wings are relatively large compared to the body, which is characteristic of terns, aiding in their flight efficiency over water. The wingtips are pointed and extend beyond the body, a feature that helps in distinguishing terns from gulls, which have more rounded wingtips. There are no additional markings or variations present on the wingtips that would suggest a different species within the tern family.",

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has a predominantly white body with grayish-blue feathers on its back and wings. Its head is mostly white with a distinct black cap extending from the back of the head down to the nape. The beak is bright orange with a black tip, which is characteristic of many tern species.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the white parts of the body. The gray-blue feathers have subtle iridescence, giving them a metallic sheen. The black cap contrasts sharply with the white face and underparts.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The tern has a streamlined body with a long, narrow tail that is slightly forked at the end. Its wings are long and pointed, tapering to a sharp point, which is typical for birds designed for swift flight over water. The overall body is compact yet elongated, allowing for agile movement.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap on the head, which is a hallmark of many tern species.
