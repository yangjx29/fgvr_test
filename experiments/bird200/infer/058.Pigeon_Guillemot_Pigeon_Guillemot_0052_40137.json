There is a distinct white patch on the upper part of its neck, which contrasts sharply with the darker feathers. The beak is short and pointed, appearing slightly curved downward, and is a dark color, possibly black or very dark brown. The eye is not clearly visible due to the angle and lighting. The tail feathers have a reddish-orange tip, adding a vibrant contrast to the otherwise muted tones of the bird's body. The overall shape of the head and neck is compact and rounded, typical of many seabirds. The size of the head and neck appears proportionate to the rest of the body, which is consistent with the bird's overall proportions.",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a Black Guillemot (Cepphus grylle). Here's a detailed focus on the wing tips:\n\n- **Color**: The wing tips have distinct white patches. These patches are bright and stand out against the dark plumage of the rest of the body.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The white patches appear smooth and are likely part of the bird's natural coloration pattern. They do not seem to have any intricate textures or patterns beyond their brightness.\n- **Shape and Size**: The white patches are located at the tips of the wings and are relatively small compared to the overall size of the wing. They are positioned towards the end of the wing, which is characteristic of this species.\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The white wing tips are a key identifying feature of the Black Guillemot. This contrast with the dark body and head makes it easily distinguishable from other seabirds.\n\nThese white wing tips are a distinctive characteristic that helps identify the Black Guillemot among similar seabird species.",
            "The tail feathers of the bird in the image are primarily red with a slight gradient, transitioning from a brighter red at the tip to a more subdued hue near the base. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light subtly. The shape is relatively small compared to the body, with a pointed tip that tapers to a fine end. The tail feathers are positioned towards the rear of the bird, extending slightly beyond the body's outline. This distinctive coloration and shape make them stand out against the bird's darker plumage and the muted background of the water."

Its body is predominantly dark, with a short, pointed beak that curves slightly downward. The tail feathers are reddish-orange at the tips, providing a vibrant contrast to the darker plumage. The wings display white patches at the tips, which are a key identifying feature of the species. The bird is swimming on calm water, with ripples around it, suggesting a natural aquatic habitat.\n\n#### Head and Neck Area:\n- **Head and Neck**: Dark brown with a smooth, slightly glossy texture. A prominent white patch is visible on the upper part of the neck, creating a stark contrast with the darker feathers.\n- **Beak**: Short and pointed, dark in color, possibly black or very dark brown.\n- **Tail Feathers**: Reddish-orange at the tips, with a smooth, glossy texture and a pointed shape.\n\n#### Wing Tips:\n- **Color**: Bright white patches at the tips of the wings.\n- **Texture**: Smooth and reflective, standing out against the dark body.\n",
