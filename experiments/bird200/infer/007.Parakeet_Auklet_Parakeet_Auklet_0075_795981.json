The head is relatively small compared to the body, which is covered in a mix of black and white feathers, creating a speckled pattern. The eye is small and dark, surrounded by the white stripe. This combination of coloration, pattern, and beak shape is distinctive and helps identify it as a species of sea duck, likely an eider or a similar type of bird.",
            "The bird in the image appears to be an eider duck, identifiable by its distinctive coloration and patterns. Here's a detailed description of its wing patterns:\n\n- **Color**: The wing feathers exhibit a mix of dark brown and black, with some white speckles scattered throughout, particularly noticeable near the edges of the wings. The primary flight feathers (remiges) have a darker, almost black appearance, while the secondary feathers (coverts) show more variation in tone, including lighter shades.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear dense and slightly glossy, typical of waterfowl, which helps them retain warmth and waterproofing. The texture is smooth and compact, especially around the body, giving it a streamlined look.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wing patterns are characterized by a mottled appearance, with the dark and light areas blending into each other. This mottling is more pronounced towards the tips of the wings, where the white speckles become more frequent. The overall pattern is irregular, providing excellent camouflage in natural habitats like rocky shores or grassy areas.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and rounded, which is common for diving ducks. They are proportionally large compared to the bird's body, aiding in efficient flight and maneuverability",
