The eye is not clearly visible due to the angle, but it seems to have a dark coloration, consistent with the overall dark markings around the eye area.\n\nThe head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of terns. The beak is proportionally large for the bird's size, aiding in catching fish. There are no visible patterns other than the black cap on the head, which helps in distinguishing this bird from others like gulls, which often have more complex markings. The overall shape of the head is rounded, with a slight indentation at the back, adding to its unique appearance.",

The wing feathers appear slightly darker than the body, showing a gradient effect from white at the base to a more grayish hue towards the tips. The tail feathers are long and narrow, fanned out slightly, and exhibit a similar grayish tone as the wings, with some lighter edges that give them a delicate appearance.\n\nThe texture of the feathers appears smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the white parts of the body. There are no distinct patterns visible on the wings or tail feathers; they are relatively uniform in color and texture, which is typical for many seabird species.\n\nThe shape of the wings is broad and slightly rounded, which is characteristic of birds adapted for gliding over water. The tail is long and pointed, aiding in maneuverability during flight. The orange legs and feet stand out against the white and gray plumage, providing a striking contrast.\n\nOverall, the bird's coloration and feather structure are consistent with those of a tern, a type of seabird known for its streamlined body and long wings suitable for efficient flight over water.",

Here's a detailed description focusing on the body and underbelly:\n\n- **Color**: The bird's body is predominantly white, with a subtle grayish tone on the upper parts, including the back and wings. The underbelly is pure white, creating a stark contrast with the darker areas. The head has a small black cap, which is a key identifying feature for terns.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the white underbelly. The texture suggests a fine, soft plumage typical of terns, which helps them glide through the air efficiently.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The body is compact and elongated, with a long, slender beak that is slightly curved at the tip. The legs are short and orange, adding a vibrant color contrast against the white body. The overall shape is aerodynamic, optimized for flight.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap on the head, which is a hallmark of many tern species.
