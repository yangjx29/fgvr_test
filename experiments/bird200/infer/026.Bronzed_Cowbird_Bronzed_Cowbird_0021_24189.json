Here's a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has a predominantly dark, almost black body with iridescent blue-green and purple hues visible under certain light conditions. This iridescence is particularly noticeable on the wings and back. The head and neck have a slightly lighter shade compared to the rest of the body.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and glossy, reflecting light and giving the bird a sleek appearance. There are no visible textures like spots, bars, or speckles that would suggest it belongs to another species.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is relatively small, with a compact body and short, pointed beak. Its wings are broad and rounded, typical of many passerine birds. The tail is short and square-cut.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The reddish eye is a distinctive feature, as it contrasts sharply with the dark plumage. The eye shape is round and alert, suggesting the bird is attentive and possibly wary of its surroundings.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The bird's plumage shows",

Its body is compact and streamlined, typical of many passerine birds, with a relatively short, pointed beak that is slightly curved at the tip, suggesting it might be an omnivore.\n\n- **Color, Texture, and Patterns**: The bird's feathers have a smooth, glossy texture that reflects light, giving them a metallic sheen. The coloration is predominantly black, with a slight iridescence that shifts depending on the angle of light. There are no distinct markings or patterns, as the plumage is uniformly dark.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The bird is small to medium-sized, fitting comfortably on the concrete curb where it is perched. Its proportions are balanced, with a compact head, medium-length neck, and a robust body. The wings are proportionate to its body, and the tail is short and square-shaped.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bird's eye, which is a striking red, contrasting sharply with the black plumage.
