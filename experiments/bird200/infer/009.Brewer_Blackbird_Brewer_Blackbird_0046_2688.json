This iridescence is more noticeable on the outer feathers.\n\n2. **Texture**: The feathers have a smooth, slightly glossy texture, which contributes to the overall sheen of the bird's plumage.

They are proportionate to the body size, neither too large nor too small.\n\n5. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - **Eye Ring**: A prominent white ring around the eye is a key identifying feature of the Common Grackle.\n   - **Bill**: The bill is pointed and slightly",
