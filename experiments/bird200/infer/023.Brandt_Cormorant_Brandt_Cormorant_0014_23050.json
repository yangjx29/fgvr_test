The neck and upper body also appear dark, with subtle variations in shading that suggest a textured plumage.\n- **Texture**: The feathers look dense and somewhat glossy, typical of cormorants, which helps them retain water when they dive for fish.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, with a short, thick beak that curves slightly downward at the tip. This beak shape is characteristic of cormorants and is adapted for catching fish underwater.\n- **Unique Features**: The eyes are small and dark, surrounded by a lighter ring, which contrasts with the darker feathers. The beak is robust and slightly hooked, aiding in gripping slippery prey.\n\nThese characteristics collectively help distinguish this bird as a cormorant, particularly within the family Phalacrocoracidae.",

The eye appears to have a smooth texture without visible patterns or speckles. Its shape is oval, typical for many bird species, and it is positioned near the top of the head, slightly offset to one side. The eye's size is proportionate to the overall head size, being neither particularly large nor small. There are no noticeable variations or special characteristics in the eye region that stand out; it blends seamlessly into the bird's plumage.",

Focusing on the wingtips and tail feathers:\n\n- **Color**: The wingtips and tail feathers are uniformly dark, blending seamlessly with the rest of the body's black feathers. There is no visible variation in coloration, suggesting a consistent dark hue throughout these areas.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, typical of cormorants, which helps them retain water for efficient diving. The texture is uniform across the wingtips and tail feathers, without any noticeable fraying or variation.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wingtips are pointed and taper to a fine tip, characteristic of cormorants. They are relatively small compared to the overall body size, which is common for birds designed for aquatic life where streamlined shapes are advantageous. The tail feathers are short and also taper to a point, contributing to the bird's streamlined appearance.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The wingtips and tail feathers do not exhibit any unique patterns or markings.

It has a robust, slightly curved beak that is characteristic of cormorants, and its head is relatively small compared to its body. The eyes are small, dark, and surrounded by a lighter ring, adding contrast to the dark feathers.
