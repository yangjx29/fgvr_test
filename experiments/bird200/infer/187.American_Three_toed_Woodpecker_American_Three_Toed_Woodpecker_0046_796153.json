This is characteristic of woodpeckers, which use their wings for maneuvering through trees.\n   - The size of the wings is proportional to the body, providing balance and stability during flight and while clinging to tree trunks.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - The wing patterns include a prominent black stripe running along the back of the wing, which is bordered by white feathers.
