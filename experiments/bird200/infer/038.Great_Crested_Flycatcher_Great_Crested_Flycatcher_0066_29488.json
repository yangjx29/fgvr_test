The beak is short and pointed, with a bluish-gray coloration.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head have a fine, soft texture, and there are subtle streaks of lighter brown and white near the eye, which can be seen as a faint pattern. The beak has a smooth, glossy appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is relatively short and stout compared to some other flycatchers, which helps it catch insects in flight.
