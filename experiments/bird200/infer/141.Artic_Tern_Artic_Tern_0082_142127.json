The long, slender body, forked tail with two long, thin streamers, and the combination of a white body with a black cap on the head and neck are distinctive features of the Forsters Tern. Additionally, the bright red beak and orange-red legs further support this identification. The similarity scores also indicate a high likelihood of it being a Forsters Tern, with a score of 0.3548, which is higher than other terns listed. | Key Features: Long, slender body, forked tail with two long, thin streamers, white body with a black cap on the head and neck, bright red beak, and orange-red legs. | Uncertainty: While the Forsters Tern is highly likely based on the visual evidence and similarity scores, there could be slight confusion with the Common Tern due to their similarities in appearance.

The beak is bright red, elongated, and slightly curved at the tip, which is a characteristic feature of terns. The texture appears smooth and glossy, typical of many seabird species. The size of the head and beak is proportionate to the overall body, with the beak being notably longer than the head itself. There are no visible variations or special characteristics in the head and beak area that set it apart from other terns, as these features are consistent with the common characteristics of the Arctic Tern, for example.",

The wingtips are sharp and pointed, with a smooth texture and a consistent white coloration. The tail feathers are long and slender, extending beyond the body, and also appear white with a slightly darker tip, giving them a subtle gradient effect.\n\nThe wings themselves are predominantly white with a slight grayish tint near the base, which transitions into a darker gray towards the tips. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light, which enhances the crispness of the white feathers. The overall shape of the wings is broad and rounded at the base, tapering to the pointed tips.\n\nThe bird's body is mostly white, with a black cap on its head and a red beak that is open, showing a pinkish interior. The contrast between the white body and the black cap creates a striking visual effect. The tail feathers are particularly distinctive due to their length and the way they extend beyond the body, adding to the bird's elegant appearance. There are no visible patterns or markings on the wingtips or tail feathers, making them uniform in color and shape.",

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has a predominantly white body with black markings on its head and neck. Its beak is bright red, which stands out against the white plumage. The legs are orange-red, adding another distinct color contrast.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the white parts of the body. The black head and neck have a fine, almost speckled pattern, giving them a textured look. The wings are long and narrow, with a slight sheen to the feathers.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The tern's body is elongated and streamlined, typical of birds adapted for flight. The wings are long and pointed, extending far beyond the tail. The tail itself is forked, with two long, thin streamers at the end, which are characteristic of many tern species.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the red beak, which is open as if it might be calling or catching prey. The orange-red legs are also notable, as they are relatively short compared to the length of the wings and body. The overall proportions suggest agility and"
