This pattern helps it blend into its natural habitat, likely for camouflage purposes.\n   - **Texture:** The feathers on the head appear slightly rough and textured, which is typical for gulls as they grow older and their feathers become more worn.\n   - **Patterns:** There are distinct lighter streaks and speckles across the head, creating a contrast against the darker background. These markings are more pronounced near the neck area.\n\n2. **Beak:**\n   - **Shape:** The beak is short and pointed, characteristic of gulls. It has a slight curve at the tip, which is used for catching fish and other prey.\n   - **Size:** The beak is relatively small compared to the body size of the bird, which is consistent with the juvenile stage of development.\n   - **Color:** The beak is a light grayish-brown, which can vary depending on the species and age.
