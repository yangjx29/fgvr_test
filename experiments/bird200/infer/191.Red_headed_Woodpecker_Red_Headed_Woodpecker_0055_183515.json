The primary feathers (remiges) are predominantly black with white tips, creating a sharp, clean edge when viewed from the side.\n   - The secondary feathers (remenisci) are also black with white tips, but they appear slightly more mottled compared to the primary feathers.\n\n2. **Shape and Size Relative to the Object:**\n   - The wings are relatively large in proportion to the body, which is typical for woodpeckers. They extend well beyond the tail when the bird is perched.\n   - The wing shape is broad and rounded at the tips, which helps in flying and maneuvering around trees.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features:**\n   - The most distinctive feature is the bright red head, which is a key identifier for this species.\n   - The white neck and chest contrast sharply with the black back and wings, making it easy to spot against a tree trunk.\n   - The white wing bars are clearly visible and add",

This coloration is consistent across all tail feathers.\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, typical of woodpeckers, which helps them adhere to tree bark.\n- **Shape and Size**: The tail feathers are relatively short compared to the body length of the bird. They are broad and fan-like when extended, aiding in balance while perching and climbing.\n- **Unique Features**: The white tips at the end of the tail feathers are a key identifying feature. These white tips contrast sharply with the black base, making them easily noticeable.\n- **Variations**: There are no significant variations in the tail feathers; they maintain the same pattern throughout.\n\nThese features, particularly the black and white tail feathers, are unique to the Red-headed Woodpecker and help distinguish it from other woodpecker species."
