This shape is characteristic of the Black Drongo and helps it catch insects mid-flight.\n\n4. **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the long, forked tail, which is not visible in this particular image but is a key identifying trait of the Black Drongo. The tail is typically very long and deeply forked, extending far beyond the length of the body.\n\n5. **Special Characteristics**: The Black Drongo has a crest on top of its head, which can be raised when the bird is agitated or excited. While the crest is not prominently displayed in this image, it is a notable feature that distinguishes it from other drongos.\n\nOverall, the combination of",

The entire body seems uniformly black, which could be characteristic of certain species like crows or ravens.\n\n4. **Shape and Size**: The tail is long and slender, extending beyond the length of the body. It tapers towards the end, giving it a streamlined appearance. The wings are also long and narrow, consistent with a bird designed for agile flight.\n\n5. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The bird's overall shape and the lack of any visible markings suggest it may belong to a species known for its plain plumage, such as a crow or raven.
