Its small, dark eyes are surrounded by a thin white ring, creating a striking contrast. The bird stands on a textured ground, suggesting a natural environment like a beach or a muddy area.\n\n#### Beak and Eye Region:\n- **Beak:** Short and slightly curved, with a dark grayish-black coloration. Faint yellowish-orange markings are visible near the base of the beak, possibly indicating wear or a natural coloration pattern.\n- **Eye:** Small and dark, with a thin white ring around them, enhancing their visibility against the black feathers.\n\n#### Wingtips:\n- The wingtips are dark, almost black, with no visible patterns or coloration. They blend seamlessly into the rest of the body, maintaining the uniform dark appearance.\n\n#### Tail Feathers:\n- The tail is short and rounded, with dark feathers that blend into the body.
