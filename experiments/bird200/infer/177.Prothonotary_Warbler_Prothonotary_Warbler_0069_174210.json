            "The bird in the image appears to be a Prothonotary Warbler (Protonotaria citrea), identifiable by several distinct features:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**: The bird has a bright yellow body with a slightly darker, olive-green back and wings. The feathers appear smooth and glossy, especially noticeable on the yellow plumage.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird is small in size, typical of warblers, with a compact body and a short, pointed beak. Its head is rounded, and it has a small, dark eye.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the vibrant yellow coloration, which is characteristic of the Prothonotary Warbler. The beak is short and conical, suitable for probing into crevices and holes in tree bark to find insects.\n\n4. **Special Characteristics**: The Prothonotary Warbler is known for nesting in cavities, often in live trees, and is sometimes called the \"Yellow Swallow\" due to its habit of perching on tree trunks and branches. The image shows the bird perched on a branch, which aligns with its natural behavior.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the Prothonotary Warbler from other similar species such as the",
