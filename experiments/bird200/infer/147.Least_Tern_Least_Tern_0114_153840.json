The most prominent feature is the distinct black cap that extends down the back of the neck, which is a hallmark of the Least Tern.

The similarity scores further support this classification, with the Least Tern having the highest score at 0.3509, indicating a strong match. | Key Features: ['Black cap extending down the back of the neck', 'Slender body', 'Pointed wings', 'Light gray body with dark wingtips'] | Uncertainty: ['While the Least Tern is highly likely based on the visual evidence, there could be slight confusion with the Common Tern due to the similarities in coloration and body shape.

            "The bird in the image appears to be a Least Tern (Sterna antillarum). Here's a detailed description focusing on the head and neck region:\n\n- **Color**: The head is predominantly white with a black cap that extends down the back of the neck. The neck itself is also white, creating a stark contrast with the black cap.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head and neck appear smooth and slightly glossy, typical of terns. There are no visible patterns other than the solid coloration.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is small and rounded, characteristic of terns. It is proportionally large compared to the body, which is slender and streamlined for flight.\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap that covers the top of the head and extends down the back of the neck. This is a key identifier for the Least Tern, distinguishing it from other tern species like the Common Tern, which has a more extensive black cap that includes the forehead.\n\nThese characteristics help distinguish the Least Tern from similar species and make it identifiable in the image.",
            "The wingtips of the bird in the image appear dark, almost black, contrasting with the lighter gray body. The texture seems smooth, typical of many seabirds, which helps them blend into their environment. There is no visible pattern on the wingtips; they are uniformly dark, which could be an adaptation for camouflage against the sky or water.\n\nIn terms of shape, the wingtips are pointed, a common feature among birds that aid in flight efficiency. They are relatively small compared to the overall body size, which is consistent with the proportions of a tern. The wingtips do not show any significant variation or distinctive features that set them apart from other bird species. They are simply part of the bird's streamlined design, optimized for flight over water.",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a Least Tern (Sterna antillarum), identifiable by several distinct features:\n\n1. **Color, Texture, and Patterns**:\n   - The bird has a predominantly white body with a gray back and wings. The head is gray with a black cap extending down the back of the neck, which is characteristic of the Least Tern.\n   - The beak is long, slender, and slightly curved downward, typical of terns, aiding in catching fish.\n   - The legs are short and orange, which contrasts with the white underparts.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**:\n   - The bird's body is streamlined, with a long, narrow tail and wings that are proportionate to its body size.\n   - Its overall size is small, consistent with the Least Tern, which is one of the smallest tern species.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - The black cap on the head is a key identifying feature, distinguishing it from other tern species like the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo) which lacks this marking.\n   - The orange legs are another distinctive trait, though some variations can occur within the species.\n\n4. **Variations or Special Characteristics**:\n  "
