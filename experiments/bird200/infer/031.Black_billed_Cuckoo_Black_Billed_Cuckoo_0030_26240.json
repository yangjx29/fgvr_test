Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The head is predominantly white with a subtle hint of yellow near the base of the beak. The eye is a striking red, which contrasts sharply with the white surrounding it. The beak is short and slightly curved, appearing bluish-gray in color.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially around the eye region. There are no visible patterns or markings on the head itself, aside from the red eye and the subtle yellow near the beak.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is relatively small compared to the body, being short and stout. It curves slightly upwards at the tip, giving it a distinctive shape. The head is proportionally large in relation to the body, contributing to the bird's overall appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most notable feature is the bright red eye, which is quite large and stands out prominently against the white head.

Here's a detailed description of its wing patterns:\n\n- **Color**: The wings have a mix of dark brown and light grayish-brown feathers. The primary flight feathers (remiges) are darker with lighter edges, creating a mottled appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear soft and slightly glossy, typical of cuckoos. They have a fine texture that is smooth to the touch.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wing patterns include a series of bars and spots. The bars are horizontal and vary in width, with some being more prominent than others. The spots are smaller and scattered across the wing, adding to the overall mottled effect.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively long compared to the body, which is characteristic of cuckoos. The wingtips are pointed and extend beyond the tail when the bird is perched.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the red eye, which is quite noticeable against the white face.
