Its head is a lighter shade of green, almost white, with a distinct black eye stripe that extends from the eye to the back of the head. The beak is short and pointed, typical of insectivorous birds, and is a pale pinkish-gray color. The legs and feet are thin and appear to be a light brown or gray.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is small in size, with a robust yet slender build. Its wings are short and rounded, which is characteristic of flycatchers, allowing them to hover and catch insects in mid-air. The tail is relatively short and square-cut, aiding in quick movements and maneuverability.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: One of the most noticeable features is the black eye stripe, which is a key identifying trait for many flycatcher species.
