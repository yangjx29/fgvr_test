The beak is short and pointed, with a slight curve at the tip, which is characteristic of terns. It is relatively small compared to the body, enhancing the bird's streamlined appearance. The beak color is a mix of grayish-blue and orange, with the orange being more prominent near the base.

The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, suggesting a healthy, well-nourished bird. The legs are relatively short compared to the body, with a robust and sturdy structure. They taper slightly towards the feet, which are also a similar orange-yellow hue. There are no visible patterns or markings on the legs, making them uniform in color and texture. This uniformity in color and lack of patterns help distinguish the legs from other birds that might have more varied leg colors or patterns. The overall shape and size of the legs are proportional to the bird's body, contributing to its balanced appearance.",

The feathers appear soft and slightly textured, giving them a fine, almost silky appearance. The wing shape is broad and rounded at the tips, typical of many seabirds, which aids in flight stability over water. The size of the wings relative to the body suggests they are proportionate for the bird's overall size.\n\nDistinctive features include the bird's open beak, revealing a hint of orange at the base, which contrasts with the white plumage. The legs are short and orange, adding another color contrast against the white feathers. The texture of the feathers appears smooth and uniform across the wings, with no visible patterns other than the natural gradient from white to grayish-blue. There are no significant variations or special characteristics noted beyond these general observations.",

Here's a detailed description focusing on its size, proportions, and distinctive features:\n\n1. **Color, Texture, and Patterns**:\n   - The bird has predominantly white plumage covering most of its body, with subtle gray tones on the wings and back. The wingtips are slightly darker, almost black, which is typical for many tern species.\n   - The head is mostly white with a small, dark patch around the eye, giving it a striking contrast. The beak is short and pointed, with a bright orange coloration at the base, which becomes more yellowish towards the tip.\n   - The legs are short and orange, adding to the bird's overall light appearance.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**:\n   - The bird's body is compact and streamlined, ideal for flight. Its wings are relatively long compared to its body, which is characteristic of terns, allowing for efficient gliding and maneuverability.\n   - The tail is short and square, contributing to its agile and graceful flight style.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - The bird's posture suggests it might be preening or flapping its wings, which"
