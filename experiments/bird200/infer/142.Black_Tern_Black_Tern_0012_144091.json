The legs are thin and black, and the feet are small and adapted for perching.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The bird's eye is dark and round, giving it an alert expression. The beak is slender and pointed, ideal for catching fish. The tail is short and squared, which helps in flight stability.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: Terns often have a white forehead and throat, which may not be fully visible in this image due to the angle and lighting.
