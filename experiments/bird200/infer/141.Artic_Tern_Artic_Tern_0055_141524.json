The tail feathers are long and forked, with a dark gray coloration.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers have a smooth texture, typical of terns, and show a slight sheen, especially noticeable on the wingtips. There is no distinct pattern other than the gradient in color from lighter at the base to darker at the tips.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively long and pointed, characteristic of terns, which aid in their swift flight over water. The tail is long and deeply forked, further aiding in maneuverability.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the forked tail, which is a key identifier for terns. Additionally, the red legs and beak are another notable characteristic, though not directly related to the wing patterns and tail feathers.\n\n- **Variations**: While the Common Tern is generally consistent in appearance, there can be slight variations in the shade of gray and the exact length of the tail",
