These patches are often referred to as \"epaulets\" and are highly visible when the bird is perched or in flight.\n   - **Tail:** The tail is relatively short and square-shaped, with a slight upward curve at the tip.\n\n2. **Shape and Size:**\n   - The bird's overall shape is compact and streamlined, typical of many blackbirds.

The wings are proportionally long and narrow, indicating agility and speed in flight. The tail is short and square-cut, which is common in many bird species.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the iridescent sheen on the feathers, which is not commonly seen in all bird species.
