The beak is long, slender, and yellow with a black tip.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head appear smooth and compact, contrasting with the slightly more textured and fluffy appearance of the body feathers. The stripe on the head is distinct and well-defined.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, which is typical for grebes. The beak is elongated and pointed, characteristic of diving birds.\n- **Unique Features**: The bright yellow beak with a black tip is a notable feature, as it stands out against the darker plumage. The white stripe on the head is another distinctive marking.\n\nThese characteristics help distinguish this bird from other similar species, such as loons or grebes, by its specific coloration and pattern.",

Its wings display a mottled pattern of dark brown and grayish tones, which is characteristic of this species. The texture of the feathers seems dense and slightly glossy, typical of grebes, providing insulation and buoyancy. The wings are relatively broad and rounded, which is consistent with the grebe's streamlined body shape designed for efficient swimming. There are no visible markings or patterns that would suggest it belongs to another species within the grebe family.
