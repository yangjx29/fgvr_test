            "The bird in the image appears to be a Bohemian Waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus). Here are the specific traits that identify it:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The bird has a predominantly grayish-brown plumage with a lighter underbelly. Its head is adorned with a distinctive crest that is often upright when alert. The crest is a mix of brown and black, creating a contrast against the lighter body. The beak is short and conical, typical of seed-eating birds.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The Bohemian Waxwing is relatively small compared to larger songbirds. It has a compact body with a rounded head and a short tail. The wings are broad and rounded, which is characteristic of waxwings.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most notable feature is the crest on the head, which is a key identifier for this species. Additionally, the bird's eyes are dark and expressive, and its legs are short and sturdy.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: Waxwings are known for their fondness for berries, as seen in the image where they are perched near a cluster of berries. They also have a unique way of eating berries by plucking them off the branch and then rolling them in their mouths",
