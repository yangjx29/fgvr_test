The beak is orange with a black tip, which contrasts sharply with the black head.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The head appears smooth and glossy, suggesting a wet or oily surface typical of waterfowl. There are no visible patterns other than the white stripe across the eye.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of many seabirds. The beak is short and stout, suitable for catching fish or other prey.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the black head with a white stripe, the orange beak with a black tip, and the overall shape of the head and beak are unique to this species. These features help distinguish it from other birds, particularly those with similar coloration but different patterns or beak shapes.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The bird's posture, with its wings slightly raised, suggests it might be in motion, possibly flapping or preparing to take off.

The feathers appear slightly glossy, suggesting a wet or oily texture, typical of seabirds. The head is a lighter shade, possibly grayish-white, with a distinct black cap extending from the back of the head down the neck. The beak is short, stout, and bright orange-yellow, which is a key identifying feature.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is small in size, consistent with auklets, which are typically smaller than puffins. Its body is rounded and streamlined, adapted for swimming and diving. The wings are broad and rounded, suitable for both flight and underwater maneuvering.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the bright orange-yellow beak, which stands out against the darker body.
