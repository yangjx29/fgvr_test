The black cap covering the top of the head and extending down the back of the neck, combined with the white body and black-tipped wings, aligns closely with the Forsters Tern's appearance.

The eye appears dark, and the overall shape of the head is rounded, typical of many tern species. The neck is relatively short compared to the length of the body, giving it a compact appearance. These features are unique and help distinguish this bird from other seabirds, particularly those with similar coloration but different head shapes or beak structures.",

The wingtips appear slightly darker than the rest of the wing, which is primarily white with subtle grayish tones. The tail feathers are black, contrasting sharply with the white body. The wingtips and tail feathers are relatively small compared to the overall body size of the bird, adding to the streamlined appearance typical of terns. The texture appears smooth, consistent with the feathers' fine structure. There are no visible patterns or additional colors on the wingtips or tail feathers; they are uniformly dark, which helps in distinguishing them from lighter-colored parts of the bird's body. This combination of dark wingtips and tail feathers, along with the white body, is characteristic of many tern species.",

The beak is primarily orange with a black band near the base, which extends along the upper mandible. This coloration is characteristic of certain seabirds, such as terns.\n\n- **Color**: The beak is predominantly bright orange, with a black band near the base. The texture appears smooth and glossy, typical of many bird beaks.\n- **Shape**: The beak is elongated and narrow, tapering to a point at the tip. It is relatively large compared to the bird's head, which is consistent with the feeding habits of many seabirds.\n- **Size**: The beak is proportionally large for the bird's head, suggesting it is adapted for catching fish or other aquatic prey.\n- **Unique Features**: The black band near the base of the beak is a notable feature that helps distinguish this bird from others. Additionally, the overall shape and coloration are consistent with that of a Royal Tern (Sterna maxima), known for its striking appearance.\n\nThese characteristics collectively make the beak easily identifiable and distinct from other bird species."

Its plumage is predominantly white, with a black cap covering the top of its head and extending down the back of the neck. The beak is long, slender, and slightly curved upwards at the tip, colored orange with a black band near the base. The eye is dark, and the overall shape of the head is rounded, typical of tern species. The wings are white with subtle grayish tones, and the wingtips are slightly darker. The tail feathers are black, contrasting sharply with the white body. The bird's posture suggests it might be calling or vocalizing, as its beak is open wide.\n\n#### Head and Neck Area:\n- **Head and Neck**: The bird has a black cap covering the top of its head and extending down the back of the neck, creating a stark contrast with the white plumage of the rest of its body. The head is rounded, and the neck is relatively short, giving the bird a compact appearance.\n- **Beak**: The beak is long, slender, and slightly curved upwards at the tip, primarily orange with a black band near",
