Its back and wings display a mix of brown and grayish tones, with darker, more pronounced streaks. The underparts are a soft, pale yellowish-white, contrasting with the darker upper parts.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is compact and rounded, characteristic of flycatchers. It has a short, stout beak that is slightly curved downward, which is adapted for catching insects mid-air. The overall size is small, consistent with many flycatcher species.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The bird's eyes are dark and round, giving it an alert appearance. The beak is short and pointed, aiding in quick, precise movements when catching prey. The legs are relatively short and sturdy, suitable for perching on branches.\n\n4. **Special Characteristics**: The bird's plumage shows a mix of warm and cool tones, with a noticeable contrast between the lighter underparts and the darker upper parts.
