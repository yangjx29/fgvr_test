The underparts are a lighter shade of brown, almost tan, with some subtle streaking. The feathers have a smooth texture.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The head is small and rounded, with a short, slightly curved beak that is dark in color. The overall body shape is streamlined, typical of swallows, with a long, narrow tail that is forked at the end.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the forked tail, which is characteristic of barn swallows.
