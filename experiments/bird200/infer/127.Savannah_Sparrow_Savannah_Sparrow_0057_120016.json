The primary flight feathers (remiges) show a pattern of dark brown bars on a lighter background, which is characteristic of the Savannah Sparrow.\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear soft and slightly fluffy, typical of sparrows.\n- **Patterns**: The wing bars are relatively broad and distinct, with a clear contrast between the darker bars and the lighter spaces. This pattern helps in distinguishing it from other sparrow species with similar coloration.\n\n### Shape and Size:\n- **Shape**: The wings are relatively short and rounded compared to some other sparrow species like the Song Sparrow (Melospiza melodia).\n- **Size**: The bird is small, consistent with the size of a sparrow, with a compact body and short tail.\n\n### Unique or Distinctive Features:\n- **Head Pattern**: The head has a streaked pattern with a light-colored supercilium (eyebrow stripe) that extends from the bill through the eye to the back of the head.
