The beak is yellowish with a dark tip, which contrasts with the lighter head color.\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear soft and slightly fluffy, especially noticeable around the neck area. The texture seems consistent across the head and neck, without any significant variation.\n- **Patterns**: There is a subtle gradient from the white base color to the grayish tones near the back of the neck. The eye area has a faint, almost indistinct, dark ring around it, which might be indicative of a slight shadowing effect rather than a distinct marking.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, typical of seabirds. The beak is short and stout, suitable for catching fish or other prey.\n- **Unique Features**: The bird's facial markings are simple yet distinctive, with the white head contrasting against the darker beak and the subtle gray tones around the neck.

            "The bird in the image appears to be a Fulmar (Fulmarus glacialis), identifiable by several distinct features:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**: The Fulmar has a predominantly white head and neck, contrasting with its darker grayish-brown wings and back. The feathers on the wings have a mottled pattern, which is typical for Fulmars, providing camouflage against the ocean backdrop.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The Fulmar's wings are broad and rounded, which is characteristic of seabirds adapted for gliding over water. The body is robust and compact, suitable for diving and swimming.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The Fulmar's most distinctive feature is its hooked bill, which is clearly visible in the image. This bill is yellowish and slightly curved, aiding in catching fish and other prey. Additionally, the Fulmar has a small, dark patch around its eye, which is another identifying trait.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: Fulmars can vary in coloration depending on their age and sex. Juveniles often have more streaked plumage on their backs compared to adults. However, the overall pattern of the wings and the shape of the bill remain consistent across individuals.\n\nIn summary, the Fulmar's combination",
