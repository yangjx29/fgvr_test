            "The bird in the image appears to be a Black Phoebe (Sayornis nigricans). Here's a detailed description focusing on its wing patterns and tail feathers:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**:\n   - **Wing Patterns**: The wings have a mix of dark brown and lighter brown feathers, creating a mottled appearance. The primary flight feathers (remiges) show a darker edge with a lighter inner portion, which is characteristic of the Black Phoebe. The secondary feathers (remixes) also exhibit a similar pattern but with more variation in color intensity.\n   - **Tail Feathers**: The tail is relatively short and square-shaped, with a dark brown coloration. The edges of the tail feathers may appear slightly frayed or worn, which is common in birds that frequently use their tails for balance.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**:\n   - The bird has a compact body with a short, square-tipped tail. Its overall size is small to medium, fitting within the typical range for a phoebe species.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - The Black Phoebe has a distinctive black cap on its head, which contrasts sharply with its white underparts. This feature is not immediately visible",

Its underparts are white, creating a stark contrast. The tail is long and slightly forked, with a dark coloration.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers have a smooth texture, and the wing feathers show subtle streaking or barring, particularly noticeable on the secondary feathers. The white underparts are clean and unmarked, providing a sharp contrast against the darker upper parts.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is relatively small, with a compact body and a short, pointed beak. Its wings are broad and rounded, and the tail is long and slightly forked. The overall body shape is streamlined, typical of many insectivorous birds.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Black Phoebe is known for its distinctive \"phoebe\" call, which is a high-pitched, descending whistle. While not visible in the image, this vocalization is a key identifying feature. Additionally, the bird often perches prominently, often on wires or rooftops,"
