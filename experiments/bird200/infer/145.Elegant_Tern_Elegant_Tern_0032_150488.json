            "The bird in the image appears to be a type of tern, characterized by its slender build and graceful flight posture. Here's a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has a predominantly white body with a black cap on its head, extending down the back of the neck. Its wings are primarily white with dark tips, and it has a bright orange beak with a black tip. The legs are thin and appear to be a light grayish color.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers look smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the white parts of the body. The black cap is solid and contrasts sharply with the white underparts. The wingtips have a darker, almost black appearance, adding definition to the wing shape.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The tern has a streamlined body typical of birds adapted for flight, with a long, pointed tail and narrow wings. Its size appears moderate compared to larger birds like seagulls, but it is not as small as some other seabirds. The wingspan seems proportionate to the body length, enhancing its aerodynamic profile.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the combination of the black cap, white body, and bright orange beak.
