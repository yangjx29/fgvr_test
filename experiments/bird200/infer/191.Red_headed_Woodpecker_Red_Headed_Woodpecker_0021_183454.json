The black feathers have white edges, creating a sharp contrast. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of woodpecker plumage.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad compared to the body, which is characteristic of woodpeckers. They are not overly long or short but fit well within the bird's overall proportions.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the red head, which is a clear indicator of the species. The wings' pattern, while not as vividly colored as the head, still provides a unique visual signature.\n\n- **Variations**: While the basic pattern described above is consistent across individuals, there can be slight variations in the intensity of the black and white coloration. Some birds may show more prominent white markings than others, but the overall pattern remains recognizable.\n\nThese wing patterns, combined with the red head, help distinguish the Red-headed Woodpecker from other similar species such as the Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus), which has",
