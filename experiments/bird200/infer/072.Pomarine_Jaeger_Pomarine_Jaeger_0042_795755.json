Additionally, the wing patterns, including the distinct bands of color and the glossy texture of the feathers, are consistent with the Sooty Albatross.

            "The bird in the image appears to be a type of seabird, possibly a petrel or shearwater, characterized by its robust build and broad wings. Here's a detailed description of its wing patterns and coloration:\n\n- **Color**: The wings exhibit a mix of dark brown and lighter grayish-brown feathers. The leading edge of the wings is darker, while the trailing edges have a lighter, almost white or pale gray hue. This coloration helps with camouflage against the sky and water.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear dense and slightly glossy, typical of seabirds that need to be waterproof for swimming and diving. The texture suggests a smooth yet slightly rough feel, which aids in flight efficiency and maneuverability.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wing patterns include distinct bands of color. The primary wing (remiges) has a clear distinction between the darker leading edge and the lighter trailing edge. The secondary wing (remen) feathers also show a gradient from dark at the tips to lighter near the body. There are no prominent spots or markings, maintaining a uniform pattern across the wings.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are broad and rounded, which is characteristic of birds adapted for long-distance flights over water. They are relatively large compared to the body, enhancing",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a petrel, identifiable by its robust build and distinctive head shape. Here's a detailed description of its head and beak:\n\n- **Color**: The head is predominantly dark gray with a slightly lighter, almost white, patch around the eye area. This contrast creates a subtle facial marking.\n- **Texture**: The feathers on the head appear smooth and slightly glossy, typical of seabirds that spend much time in water.\n- **Patterns**: There are no prominent stripes or spots; the coloration is relatively uniform except for the lighter eye patch.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is rounded and compact, which is characteristic of petrels. It is proportionally small compared to the body, reflecting the bird's streamlined design for efficient flight over water.\n- **Beak Structure**: The beak is short and stout, with a slight curve at the tip, which is adapted for catching fish and squid. The upper mandible has a distinct hook-like projection, aiding in gripping slippery prey.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the bird as a petrel, setting it apart from other seabirds like gulls or terns, which typically have more slender beaks and different head shapes.",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a large seabird, likely a petrel or shearwater, characterized by its robust build and long wings. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The bird has a predominantly dark brown plumage on its back and wings, with lighter, almost white underparts. The feathers appear slightly textured, suggesting a thick, downy layer beneath the outer feathers, which is typical for birds adapted to cold climates. There are subtle darker markings on the wings, possibly indicating flight feathers.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is relatively elongated and streamlined, with a broad, rounded head and a short, stout beak. Its wings are long and pointed, extending far beyond the tail when in flight, which is characteristic of seabirds designed for efficient gliding over water. The overall size suggests it is a medium to large bird, larger than a gull but smaller than a cormorant.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The bird's wings are particularly notable, with a slight curve at the tips, which aids in maneuverability during flight. The tail is short and square, further aiding in stability while flying close to the water's surface. The legs are short and set far back on the body,"
