The prominent black eye-ring extending from the base of the bill around the eye is a defining feature of this species.

This red coloration is particularly vivid against the green plumage. The eye is surrounded by a thin white ring, adding contrast.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The Red-eyed Vireo has a subtle pattern on its head, often described as a \"eyebrow\" or \"eyebrow stripe,\" which is a light gray or white line above the eye.
