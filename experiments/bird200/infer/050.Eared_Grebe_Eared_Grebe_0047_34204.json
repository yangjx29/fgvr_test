The neck is short and thick, blending into the body without a distinct separation.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head are smooth and appear slightly ruffled, giving it a slightly fluffy appearance. There are no visible patterns other than the solid coloration.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is small relative to the body, with a rounded shape. The beak is short and pointed, typical of grebes, and is dark in color, matching the head.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bright red eye, which stands out vividly against the black head. This is a key characteristic used to identify the Black-necked Grebe.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The bird's overall appearance is streamlined, adapted for swimming and diving.
