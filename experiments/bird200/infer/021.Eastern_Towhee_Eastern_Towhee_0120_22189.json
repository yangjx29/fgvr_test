The black feathers are prominent, forming a bold contrast with the lighter areas. The texture of the feathers is smooth and well-defined, contributing to the sharpness of the wing patterns.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and rounded, typical of towhees. They extend outward from the body, showcasing the intricate feather patterns. The size of the wings is proportional to the bird's overall body, which is compact and robust.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the combination of black, white, and orange-brown feathers on the wings. This coloration is not only visually distinct but also serves as a key identifier for the species. The black feathers form a solid base, while the white and orange-brown feathers create a patterned appearance, adding depth and complexity to the wing design.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The wing patterns are consistent across individuals of the same species, making them a reliable characteristic for identification.

It is primarily black with a slight reddish-brown coloration at the base, which extends up the outer edges of the feathers. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light subtly. The tail is relatively large compared to the body, adding to the bird's overall profile. The forked shape is clearly visible, with two main prongs extending outward, creating a fan-like appearance.
