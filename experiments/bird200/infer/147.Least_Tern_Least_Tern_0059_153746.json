            "The bird in the image has a distinct head and beak area that is characteristic of terns. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The head is predominantly black, which contrasts sharply with the white body. The beak is slender and pointed, with a bright orange coloration that stands out against the black head.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The head appears smooth and glossy, suggesting a wet or oily texture typical of birds that spend much time in water. There are no visible patterns or markings on the head, making it a solid black color.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is long and thin, tapering to a sharp point. It is relatively small compared to the overall size of the bird, which is consistent with the proportions of terns. The head itself is small in relation to the body, which is also typical for terns.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the black head, white body, and bright orange beak is unique to terns and helps distinguish them from other seabirds. The pointed beak is adapted for catching fish, which is a common food source for terns.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The bird's wings are fully extended, indicating it is in flight. The wings are long and narrow",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a tern, identifiable by its slender body, forked tail, and long, pointed wings. Here's a detailed description focusing on the wingtips and tail feathers:\n\n- **Color**: The wingtips are dark gray, contrasting with the lighter gray of the rest of the wing. The tail feathers are also dark gray, appearing slightly darker than the wingtips.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The wingtips have a smooth texture with no visible patterns. The tail feathers are similarly smooth and lack any distinct markings.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wingtips are sharp and pointed, extending beyond the main body of the wing. They are relatively small compared to the overall size of the wing, which is characteristic of terns. The tail feathers are thin and elongated, forming a forked shape at the end.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The forked tail is a key feature of terns, distinguishing them from other seabirds like gulls. The pointed wingtips and the overall streamlined body further contribute to their identification as terns.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The tern's wings are relatively narrow and long, which is typical for birds that spend much of their time flying over water. This adaptation",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a Common Tern (Sterna hirundo). Here's a detailed description focusing on its overall body shape and posture:\n\n1. **Color, Texture, and Patterns**:\n   - **Head**: The head is predominantly black with a white stripe running through the eye, giving it a distinctive \"mask\" appearance.\n   - **Body**: The upper parts of the body, including the wings and back, are white with some subtle grayish tones, especially noticeable on the wingtips.\n   - **Underparts**: The underparts are entirely white, creating a stark contrast with the black head.\n   - **Beak**: The beak is long, slender, and slightly curved downward, which is characteristic of terns. It is orange with a black tip.\n   - **Legs and Feet**: The legs are short and orange, ending in webbed feet.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**:\n   - **Wings**: The wings are long and pointed, with a slight curve at the tips, which is typical for terns. They are fully extended in the image, showcasing their length.\n   - **Tail**: The tail is forked into three or four points, which is another distinguishing feature of terns.\n"
