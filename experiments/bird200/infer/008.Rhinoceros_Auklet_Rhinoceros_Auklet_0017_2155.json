The primary feathers (remiges) are predominantly dark, almost black, with some lighter edges, creating a contrast. The secondary feathers (remen) have a more mottled appearance, with patches of lighter gray and white interspersed within the darker areas.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear slightly glossy, which is typical for birds that spend much time in water, as it helps them stay dry and streamlined. The texture seems dense and compact, providing good insulation and protection against the elements.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wing patterns include distinct bands and streaks of lighter and darker colors. These patterns are not uniform across the wing; they vary in intensity and placement, giving the wing a textured look rather than a smooth gradient.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and rounded at the tips, which is characteristic of many seabirds.

The wings are broad and slightly rounded at the tips, which is typical for diving birds.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the orange beak with a black tip, which is a clear identifier for certain seabird species.
