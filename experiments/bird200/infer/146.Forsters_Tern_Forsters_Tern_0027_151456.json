            "The bird in the image has a slender, elongated head with a small, pointed beak that is slightly curved downward at the tip. The beak is primarily dark grayish-black, contrasting with the lighter coloration of the rest of the head.\n\nThe head itself is predominantly white, with a subtle hint of gray or light brown around the eyes, creating a soft, mottled pattern. This area around the eyes gives the impression of a faint mask-like marking, which is characteristic of some tern species. The eye itself appears dark and is encircled by a thin, dark ring, adding to the distinctiveness of the head's appearance.\n\nThe texture of the head seems smooth and slightly glossy, typical of many seabirds, which helps in distinguishing it from birds with rougher or more textured plumage. The overall shape of the head is rounded yet elongated, fitting well with the streamlined body typical of terns, which aids in their flight efficiency over water.\n\nIn summary, the combination of the dark beak, white head with a subtle grayish hue around the eyes, and the smooth, glossy texture makes this bird easily identifiable as a tern, particularly one that might belong to the genus Sterna, known for such markings.",
            "The bird in the image has distinct wingtips and tail feathers that are primarily white with subtle grayish tones. The wingtips appear slightly darker than the rest of the wings, giving them a more defined edge. The tail feathers are long and slender, extending beyond the body, and they have a smooth texture with no visible patterns. The overall shape is streamlined, typical of birds adapted for flight, with the tail feathers contributing to aerodynamic efficiency. The wingtips and tail feathers are relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of many seabirds. There are no unique markings or colors on these parts that set it apart from other similar categories, as they blend seamlessly into the bird's overall light gray and white plumage.",
            "The bird in the image has slender, orange legs with a slight reddish hue. The texture appears smooth, and there is no visible pattern on the legs. The size of the legs is proportionate to the body, providing a balanced look. The feet are small and compact, ending in sharp, dark claws that are well-suited for gripping surfaces like sand or rocks. These features are characteristic of wading birds, which often have long legs and strong feet adapted for standing in shallow water. The orange coloration of the legs is a distinctive feature that helps identify the bird as belonging to a specific species, likely a tern, given the overall body shape and beak structure."

Its plumage is predominantly light gray and white, with subtle variations in tone. The bird stands on a sandy surface, suggesting an environment near coastal areas where terns are commonly found.\n\n#### Head and Beak Area:\n- **Beak**: The beak is slender, elongated, and slightly curved downward at the tip, primarily dark grayish-black in color. This shape is typical of terns, aiding in efficient feeding behavior.\n- **Head**: The head is predominantly white, with a subtle hint of gray or light brown around the eyes, creating a soft, mottled pattern. This area around the eyes resembles a faint mask-like marking, which is characteristic of certain tern species. The eyes are dark, encircled by a thin, dark ring, enhancing the bird’s distinct appearance.\n- **Texture**: The head appears smooth and slightly glossy, consistent with the plumage of many seabirds, which helps in distinguishing it from birds with rougher textures.\n\n#### Wingtips and Tail Feathers:\n- **Wingtips**: The wingtips are primarily white with subtle",
