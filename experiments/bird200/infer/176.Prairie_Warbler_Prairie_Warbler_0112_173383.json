Its small, rounded head and narrow, pointed wings are characteristic of warbler species. The bird's beak is short and dark grayish-black, adding contrast to its bright yellow head. The tail is short and slightly rounded, blending seamlessly with the rest of the body.\n\n#### Head and Upper Chest Area:\n- **Coloration and Pattern Details:** The head and upper chest are a vivid yellow, smooth, and glossy in texture. A subtle horizontal streaking pattern of darker, almost black, lines runs across the head, particularly near the eye, forming a thin, dark line. This pattern is more pronounced around the eye area.\n- **Size and Shape:** The head is small and rounded, typical of warbler species.
