It is slightly curved at the tip, which is typical for birds that feed by probing into crevices or soft surfaces.\n\nThe head is small compared to the body, which is characteristic of many seabirds. The eye is not clearly visible due to the angle of the photograph, but it likely has a dark coloration, common among birds for contrast against their lighter plumage.

The underwing is predominantly white with subtle grayish tones near the leading edge.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the wing tips are thick and appear slightly frayed, giving them a rugged texture. The pattern includes a mix of dark and light feathers, creating a mottled appearance. The leading edge of the wing has a distinct darker band, which contrasts sharply with the lighter areas.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are broad and rounded, typical of seabirds like fulmars, which are adapted for gliding over water. The wingtips are relatively short compared to the overall length of the wing, contributing to their characteristic shape.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The fulmar's wings exhibit a unique pattern where the dark tips contrast with the lighter underwing.
