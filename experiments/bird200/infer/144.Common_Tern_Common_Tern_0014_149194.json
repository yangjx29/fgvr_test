The body is predominantly gray, transitioning to white on the underside. The tail is long and forked, with dark tips.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers have a smooth texture, and the black head contrasts sharply with the lighter body. The white stripe on the head is distinct and well-defined.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is slender and pointed, typical of terns, and is bright red with a black tip. The overall body shape is streamlined, which is characteristic of birds adapted for flight over water.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The long, forked tail is a key identifier for terns. The combination of the black cap, white stripe, and gray body is unique to the Common Tern among similar species like the Arctic Tern, which has a more extensive white cap and a shorter tail.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The Common Tern is known for its graceful flight and is often seen hovering over water, diving for fish.

            "The bird in the image appears to be a Common Tern (Sterna hirundo). Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n1. **Color, Texture, and Patterns:**\n   - **Wing Patterns:** The wings are primarily gray with a slight iridescence, especially noticeable under certain light conditions. There is a subtle pattern of darker and lighter bands near the tips of the primary feathers, which can be seen more clearly when the bird is in flight.\n   - **Tail Feathers:** The tail is long and forked, with dark gray outer feathers and a lighter gray inner section. The forked shape is a key identifying feature.\n\n2. **Shape and Size:**\n   - The bird has a slender body with a long, pointed beak that is slightly curved at the tip. This beak is bright red, contrasting sharply with the black cap and gray body.\n   - The overall size is relatively small compared to larger seabirds like gulls, but it is larger than many smaller shorebirds.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features:**\n   - The black cap covering the head and neck is a distinctive feature, as it contrasts sharply with the white face and gray body.\n   - The bright red beak is",
