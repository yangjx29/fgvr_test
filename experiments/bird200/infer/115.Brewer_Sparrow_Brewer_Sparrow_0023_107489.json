The overall shape of the head is rounded, with a slight crest at the top, which is characteristic of some sparrow species.\n\nThese features collectively help identify the bird as belonging to a specific genus, likely a sparrow, though further identification would require more detailed information or a clearer view of other distinguishing features such as wing patterns",
