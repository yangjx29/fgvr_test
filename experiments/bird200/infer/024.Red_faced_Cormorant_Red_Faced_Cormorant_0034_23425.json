The beak is long, slender, and slightly curved downward, appearing light grayish-white in color. The texture of the feathers appears smooth and slightly glossy, particularly around the head and neck area. The overall shape of the head is rounded at the top, with a small crest of feathers that stand upright, adding to its distinctive appearance. The size of the head relative to the body is proportionate, with the head being relatively smaller compared to the body length.

            "The bird in the image appears to be a cormorant, identifiable by its dark plumage and distinctive red facial patch. Here's a detailed description focusing on the body feathers and wing patterns:\n\n- **Color**: The primary color of the bird is a deep black, covering most of its body. The wings also appear dark, with subtle hints of a lighter shade at the tips, possibly indicating feather wear or a different feather type.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers seem dense and slightly glossy, typical of cormorants, which helps them retain water. The texture appears smooth and compact, without visible downy underfeathers that might be present in some other bird species.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are no distinct patterns on the body feathers; the overall appearance is uniform in color. The wings do not show any prominent markings or stripes, maintaining the dark, solid coloration.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a streamlined body shape, adapted for swimming, with a long, pointed beak that is slightly curved downward. The wings are broad and rounded, suitable for both flight and diving.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the bright red facial patch around the eyes, which is a distinctive characteristic of many cormorant species.

Additionally, the bird's posture suggests it might be resting or nesting, as it is perched on what looks like a nest made of twigs and other natural materials.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish this bird as a cormorant, setting it apart from other seabirds or waterfowl that may share some color"
