The beak is short and pointed, typical of shrikes, and it has a black coloration. The body is primarily light gray with some darker streaks, especially noticeable on the wings, which are darker than the rest of the body. The tail is relatively short and squared off.\n\nIn contrast, a Mockingbird typically has a more rounded head and a longer, thinner beak. Its plumage can vary widely, but it often includes a mix of colors such as brown, gray, and white, with a lighter underside. The Mockingbird's tail is usually longer and more rounded at the tip.\n\nThe bird in the image does not exhibit the long, slender tail or the varied coloration seen in many Mockingbirds. Instead, it has a more uniform gray coloration and a shorter, sturdier beak, which aligns more closely with the physical characteristics of the Great-Grey Shrike.",

The underparts are white, creating a clear contrast with the upper parts. The feathers have a smooth texture, and there is a subtle sheen, especially noticeable on the back.\n\n2. **Wing Patterns**: The wings display a pattern of dark and light bands. The primary wing feathers (remiges) are dark, while the secondary feathers (remora) show lighter edges, creating a striped effect. The wingtips are pointed and slightly rounded at the base, which is characteristic of shrikes.\n\n3. **Tail Shape**: The tail is short and square-tipped, another key feature of the Northern Shrike. It is dark gray with a slight reddish-brown tinge near the tip, which can sometimes be seen in certain lighting conditions.\n\n4. **Unique Features**: The bird's beak is short and slightly curved downward, which is typical for insectivorous birds like shrikes.
