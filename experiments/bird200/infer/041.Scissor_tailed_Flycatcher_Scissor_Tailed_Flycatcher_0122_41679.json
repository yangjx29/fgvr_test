Its body is a mix of gray and white, with a yellow wash on the underside, particularly noticeable on the belly and flanks.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird's head is small and rounded, typical of warblers.

Additionally, the bird's long, slightly forked tail is another key identifier.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The bird's plumage can vary depending on the season and age, but the yellow patch remains consistent. The wing patterns, including the black streaks, are also consistent across individuals of this species.\n\nThese characteristics help distinguish the Yellow-rumped Warbler from other similar species such as the Yellow Warbler (Dendroica petechia) or the Orange-crowned Warbler (Zosterops coronatus), which",
