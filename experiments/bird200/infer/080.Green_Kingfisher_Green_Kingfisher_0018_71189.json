The tail is short and broad, with a pattern of alternating dark and light bands, which is characteristic of many kingfisher species.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and glossy, reflecting light, which is typical for kingfishers, aiding in their camouflage and visual appeal.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wing patterns include a combination of solid and streaked areas, with the blue feathers having subtle white streaks. The tail's banding is distinct, with clear, sharp lines separating the dark and light sections.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad compared to the body, which is typical for kingfishers, allowing them to maneuver effectively while hunting fish. The tail is short and square-shaped, aiding in stability during flight and diving.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The kingfisher's wings and tail are designed for both flight and diving, with the wings being broad and the tail providing stability underwater.
