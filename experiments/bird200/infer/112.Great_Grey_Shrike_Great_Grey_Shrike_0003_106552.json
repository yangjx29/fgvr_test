The underparts are lighter, almost white, with a subtle hint of gray. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of many passerine birds.\n\n2. **Wing Patterns**: The wings have black and white markings.

This pattern is characteristic of the Northern Shrike and helps distinguish it from other similar species like the Loggerhead Shrike (Lanius ludovicianus).\n\n3. **Tail Shape**: The tail is long and slightly forked, which is another key feature of the Northern Shrike. It is not as deeply forked as some other shrikes, but the slight division at the end is noticeable.\n\n4. **Unique Features**: The bird's beak is short and slightly curved, which is typical for insectivorous birds.
