The beak is slender and pointed, with a bright orange coloration that contrasts sharply with the white head. The texture appears smooth and glossy, typical of birds' feathers. The beak's size is relatively small compared to the body, being proportionate to the bird's overall size. There are no visible patterns other than the black cap on the head. The beak's shape is elongated and slightly curved, aiding in catching fish, which is consistent with the bird's likely diet. This combination of features—white head, black cap, orange beak, and streamlined body—helps distinguish it from other seabirds like gulls, which typically have more varied coloration and larger beaks.",

The texture seems smooth, typical of many seabirds, and there is no visible pattern other than the natural color gradient. The wings are fully extended, showcasing their size relative to the body, which is characteristic of birds designed for efficient flight over water.\n\nThe tail feathers are short and pointed, with a slight curve at the tip, which is common among terns and gulls. They are also white, matching the underparts of the bird, and do not have any distinct markings or patterns. The tail's shape and size contribute to the bird's streamlined appearance, aiding in flight efficiency.\n\nThe wingtips and tail feathers are sharp and well-defined, indicating the bird's agility and speed. There are no visible variations or special characteristics that set these features apart from those of other similar seabirds; they are consistent with the general morphology of terns or gulls.",

The wings are primarily white with a slight grayish tint near the tips, which become more pronounced as they extend outward. The underwings show a pattern of white with a thin black band near the leading edge, which is characteristic of terns.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird has a slender, streamlined body typical of terns, with long, pointed wings and a forked tail. Its beak is short and pointed, with a bright orange coloration that contrasts sharply with the black tip. The legs are also orange and appear relatively short compared to the bird's overall length.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap on the head, which is a key identifying trait for terns. Additionally, the bird's posture, with wings fully extended and tail fanned out, suggests it is either taking off or landing, which is common behavior for terns when they are near water.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: Common Terns have a consistent pattern"
