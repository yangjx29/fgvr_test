Its underparts are white, and it has a distinct black stripe across the top of its head, which is characteristic of the species. The bill is short and conical, typical for seed-eating birds.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers have a soft, slightly fluffy texture, which is common in many songbirds. The black stripe on the head is bold and contrasts sharply with the lighter surrounding feathers. The white underparts are smooth and clean.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is small to medium-sized, with a compact body and a relatively short tail. Its wings are proportionate to its body, and the tail is short and rounded. The overall shape is streamlined, allowing for agile flight.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black stripe across the top of the head, which is unique to the White-crowned Sparrow.
