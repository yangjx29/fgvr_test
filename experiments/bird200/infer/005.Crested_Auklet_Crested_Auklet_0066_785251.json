The wings exhibit a mix of darker and lighter shades, creating a mottled pattern. The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, typical of seabirds.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is relatively small, with a compact body and short, thick legs adapted for swimming. Its wings are broad and rounded, which is characteristic of auks, aiding in their flight and diving capabilities.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the bright orange bill, which contrasts sharply with the dark head and back. The eyes are large and white, surrounded by a thin black stripe that extends from the eye to the bill, adding to the bird's distinctive appearance.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The auklet's head is adorned with a tuft of feathers that stand upright, giving it a crest-like appearance. This crest is more prominent in males during breeding season. The overall shape and coloration make it easily distinguishable from other seabirds, such as puffins or guillemots, which",
