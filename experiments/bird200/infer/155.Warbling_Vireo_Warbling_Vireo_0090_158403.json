The upper parts (primarily the back and wings) have a more pronounced brownish-gray tone, while the underparts are lighter, almost white, with faint streaks.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the wings exhibit a fine, slightly textured appearance, typical of vireos. The pattern is relatively uniform across the wing, with no distinct spots or patches. The edges of the feathers appear slightly frayed, which is common in many bird species.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively short and broad compared to some other songbirds. They are not pointed like those of swifts or swallows, nor are they rounded like those of thrushes. The wings are proportionate to the body size, which is compact and rounded.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature of the wings is the contrast between the darker upper parts and the lighter underparts. This contrast is consistent throughout the wing, creating a subtle but noticeable pattern. There are no bright",
