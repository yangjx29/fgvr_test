Its wings are also white, with dark tips and some darker markings near the wingtips, which is typical of many gull species. The head is white, and there is a small black patch around the eye, which is characteristic of certain gull species.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the wings where the light reflects off the surface. There are no visible patterns other than the dark tips on the wings and the black eye patch.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a robust, streamlined body with a broad, rounded head and a short, stout beak that is slightly curved at the tip. The wings are long and broad, tapering towards the tips, which are dark. The tail is short and square-shaped.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The bird's posture suggests it is in flight, with its wings fully extended.
