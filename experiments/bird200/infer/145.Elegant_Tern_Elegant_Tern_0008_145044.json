Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The wings are primarily white with black wingtips, creating a stark contrast. The tail is also black, adding to the overall striking appearance.\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, typical of terns, which helps them blend into their coastal environments.\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are long and pointed, which is common for terns, aiding in their swift flight over water. The body is slender and streamlined, suitable for diving and maneuvering in aquatic habitats.\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap on the head, which extends down the back of the neck, contrasting sharply with the white face and underparts. This cap is a key identifier for many tern species.\n- **Variations**: While the basic pattern described here is common, there can be slight variations in the intensity of the black and white colors, and some species may have additional markings or coloration on the head or body.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish this bird as a tern, particularly one that might belong to a species like the Common Tern (Sterna hirundo), known for its elegant",

The legs are short and dark, contrasting with the lighter coloration of the rest of the body.\n\nThe tern's posture is upright and alert, suggesting it is attentive to its surroundings. Its wings are slightly folded against its body, indicating a relaxed yet ready stance. The overall size of the bird is small to medium, typical for terns, and it stands out due to its sharp, streamlined profile and the bold contrast between its black and white plumage."
