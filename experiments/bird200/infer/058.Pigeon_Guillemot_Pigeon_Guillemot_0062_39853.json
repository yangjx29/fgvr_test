The tail feathers are also dark, blending seamlessly into the body color.\n\n2. **Texture**: The feathers have a smooth texture, which is characteristic of waterfowl. They appear slightly oily, reflecting light, which is common in seabirds to help waterproof their plumage.\n\n3. **Patterns**: There is a distinct white patch on the upper part of the wing, which is a key identifying feature of the Black Guillemot. This patch is often referred to as a \"shoulder patch\" and is a clear distinction from other similar species like the Pigeon Guillemot (Cepphus columba), which lacks this white patch.\n\n4. **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively short and broad compared to many other seabirds, which helps them maneuver in tight spaces and dive underwater easily. The tail is short and square-cut, another characteristic feature.\n\n5. **Unique Features**: The Black Guillemot has a small, pointed bill that",
