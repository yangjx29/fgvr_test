It is proportionate to the head, neither too long nor too short.\n- **Unique Features**: The white ring around the eye is particularly striking and helps to distinguish this bird from others in its category. This ring is not only a color contrast but also a structural feature that stands out.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The bird's overall plumage is uniform in color, suggesting it might be a species that relies on camouflage in its natural habitat.

There are no visible patterns or markings on the body, which helps in distinguishing it from other seabirds like gulls or terns that often have more distinct markings.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are long and narrow, characteristic of seabirds adapted for gliding over water.

This ring is clearly visible in the image and contrasts sharply with the dark brown surrounding it.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The Brown Skua has a robust build, with a strong, hooked beak suited for catching fish.

The beak is short and stout, with a slight curve at the tip, suitable for gripping prey.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the white ring around the eye, which is a distinctive characteristic of fulmars. This ring contrasts sharply with the dark coloration of the rest of the head. Additionally, the bird's posture is relaxed, with its wings folded close to its body, suggesting it might be resting or foraging on the ground.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: Fulmars are known for their ability to remain airborne for long periods, often seen gliding over the ocean.
