The texture of the head seems smooth, and there are no visible patterns other than the black stripe.\n\nThe head is relatively small compared to the body, which is typical for many bird species. The beak is proportionally large in relation to the head, emphasizing its importance for feeding habits. There are no unique markings or spots on the head; it is uniformly colored except for the black stripe. The overall shape of the head is rounded at the top, tapering down to the beak. This combination of features—white head, black stripe, and elongated beak—helps distinguish this bird from others, particularly those without such a distinctive facial marking.",

Its back and wings display a mix of gray and brown feathers, which are more prominent on the upper parts of the body. The tail is dark, almost black, with a slight hint of gray.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the wings have a slightly iridescent quality, especially noticeable on the edges where they catch the light. The wing patterns include a series of bars and spots, creating a mottled appearance. These markings are more pronounced on the upper wing surfaces and less so on the underside.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird's wings are relatively long and pointed, typical of cuckoos, which aid in their flight. The overall size of the bird is medium, with a robust body and a long tail.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bright yellow-orange bill, which contrasts sharply with the rest of the plumage. This coloration is unique among cuckoos and helps in identification. Additionally, the bird's posture,",
