The texture appears smooth, suggesting a healthy and well-maintained plumage.\n\nThe tail is short and forked, with two distinct, slightly rounded lobes at the end. This feature is characteristic of terns and gulls, helping to distinguish it from other seabirds like gannets or albatrosses, which have longer, more deeply forked tails.\n\nThe bird's overall body is streamlined, with a slender neck and a small, pointed beak that is dark in color, likely black or dark gray. The head is also white, blending seamlessly into the body, which is another common trait among terns and gulls.\n\nThe wingspan is notably large compared to the body, which is a key distinguishing feature for this type of bird. The wings extend far beyond the length of the body, giving the bird a graceful and aerodynamic appearance as it soars through the sky. The tail's shortness and the wings' elongated shape contribute to the bird's efficient",

It is relatively small compared to the overall body size of the bird, which is consistent with many seabirds. The beak's shape and size are typical for a tern, aiding in catching fish by allowing it to pierce through water efficiently. There are no visible patterns or markings on the beak, making it uniform in color and texture.

The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, suggesting a healthy condition. There is a subtle dark line along the wing edges, which is typical for many tern species.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The bird's wings are long and narrow, extending far beyond its body, giving it a streamlined appearance. Its tail is short and square, which is characteristic of terns. The head is small and pointed, with a sharp, hooked beak that is dark in color.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The bird's most distinctive feature is its long, slender wings and the pointed tail. These adaptations are well-suited for efficient flight over water, allowing terns to catch fish with ease. The bird's posture, with wings fully extended, suggests it is in flight, possibly gliding or preparing to land.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: Terns can vary in size and coloration depending on the species.
