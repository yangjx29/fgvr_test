The orange-red patch is relatively small compared to the overall body size but is highly noticeable due to its vivid hue and contrast with the surrounding feathers. The shape of the throat area is slightly rounded and slightly raised, adding to its distinctiveness. There are no visible patterns or additional colors within this patch; it is a uniform shade of orange-red, making it a key identifying feature for distinguishing this hummingbird from others.",

They appear dark green with subtle iridescent hints, blending seamlessly into the bird's overall plumage. The texture is smooth and glossy, reflecting light, which is typical for hummingbirds' feathers. There are no distinct patterns or markings on the tail feathers; they maintain a consistent coloration throughout their length. The size of the tail feathers is relatively small compared to the body, as is common among hummingbirds, aiding in their agility and maneuverability during flight. No special or unique features stand out in the tail feathers of this particular bird, as they conform to the general morphology of hummingbird tails.",

It is primarily black with a slight sheen, indicating a smooth texture. The beak is relatively small compared to the bird's body, which is typical for hummingbirds, emphasizing their specialized feeding habits. There are no visible patterns or colors on the beak itself; it appears uniformly dark. The beak's shape is slightly curved at the tip, aiding in precise feeding. This beak shape and size are distinct and help identify the bird as a hummingbird, distinguishing it from other bird species with different beak structures."
