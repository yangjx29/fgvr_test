The tail is primarily black with white tips, which are clearly visible.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and well-defined, with a slight sheen that suggests they are healthy and well-maintained.

The size of the wings and tail is proportional to the overall body size of the bird, indicating a medium-sized bird.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of black and white feathers, especially the white tips on the tail, is quite distinctive.
