            "The bird in the image appears to be a crow, identifiable by its dark plumage and robust build. Here's a detailed description focusing on the wing patterns and tail shape:\n\n- **Color**: The crow's feathers are uniformly dark, ranging from deep black to a slightly iridescent blue-black, especially noticeable in certain lighting conditions. There is no visible variation in coloration within the wings or tail.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and glossy, reflecting light in a way that suggests a healthy, well-maintained coat. The texture is consistent across the body, with no visible signs of wear or damage.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wings show subtle feather markings, with slight variations in shade and some faint, almost imperceptible streaking near the edges. These markings are not distinct enough to form any recognizable pattern but contribute to the overall dark appearance.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are broad and rounded at the tips, which is typical for crows. The tail is relatively short compared to some other bird species, with a slightly rounded tip. The overall shape is compact and streamlined, characteristic of a bird designed for efficient flight and maneuverability.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The crow's beak is strong and curved, adapted for tearing flesh and cracking",

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The bird is predominantly black with a glossy sheen, indicating healthy feathers. There are no visible color variations or patterns other than the natural sheen of the feathers.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and well-groomed, with a fine texture that reflects light, giving them a lustrous appearance. The edges of the feathers are sharp and defined, contributing to the bird's streamlined look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The crow has a robust yet slender build. Its body is compact and rounded, with a relatively short neck and a strong, pointed beak. The wings are broad and slightly rounded at the tips, which is typical for crows. The tail is short and square-cut, adding to the bird's overall compactness.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bird's beak, which is straight and slightly curved downward at the tip, ideal for cracking nuts and other hard foods. The eyes are small and dark, set deep within the head, giving the bird an intense and alert expression.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: Crows can vary in"
