Here’s a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has a predominantly dark plumage with a glossy black back and wings. Its underparts are white, creating a stark contrast. The head is also dark, with a small, pointed beak that is slightly curved downward.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and sleek, typical of swift-like birds. There are no visible patterns or markings on the wings or body, aside from the natural color gradients.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are long and narrow, with a slight curve at the tips, which is characteristic of swallows. The tail is deeply forked into two long, thin streamers, a feature that is unique to this species. The overall body is compact and aerodynamic, designed for swift flight.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the forked tail, which is clearly visible in the image. This is a key identifier for swallows. Additionally, the bird's posture, with its wings outstretched and body angled, suggests it might be in mid-flight or preparing to land.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: Sw",

Here's a detailed description of its coloration and features:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has a predominantly black body with white underparts. The head is dark, almost black, with a small, pointed beak that is slightly curved downward. The wings are dark, with a slight iridescence that can appear bluish or greenish depending on the light.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers have a smooth texture, typical of birds, with some subtle variations in color intensity. There are no visible patterns other than the contrast between the black and white areas.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is relatively small compared to the wooden structure it is perched on. Its body is slender and elongated, with a long, narrow tail that is deeply forked into two points. The wings are broad and rounded at the tips.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the forked tail, which is characteristic of swallows.

Its size is proportionate to the bird's head, neither too large nor too small, maintaining balance and agility.\n- **Unique Features**: The beak's shape and size are uniquely suited for its feeding habits, allowing it to maneuver quickly and precisely while hunting.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the beak as that of a swallow, setting it apart from other bird species with different beak shapes and sizes."
