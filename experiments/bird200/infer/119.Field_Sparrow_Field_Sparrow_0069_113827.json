The feathers have a slightly textured appearance, giving them a soft, almost velvety look.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth yet slightly ruffled, typical of a field sparrow's plumage. This texture adds depth and dimension to the wing patterns.\n\n- **Patterns**: The wings feature prominent bars and spots. The bars are horizontal stripes running across the wing, alternating between lighter and darker shades of brown and gray. These bars are well-defined and create a clear pattern. The spots are smaller, scattered across the wing, adding to the intricate design. The edges of these bars and spots are somewhat irregular, contributing to the natural, field sparrow aesthetic.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of many sparrow species. The shape is broad and rounded, with the tips tapering slightly towards the end.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the barred and spotted patterns, along with the coloration, is unique to",

There is no distinct pattern on the tail feathers; they are uniformly colored without any noticeable stripes or spots.
