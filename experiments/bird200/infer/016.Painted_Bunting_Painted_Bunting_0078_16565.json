There is no visible pattern on the wing feathers; they are uniformly colored, which helps in distinguishing them from other birds with more intricate feather patterns.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wing feathers are broad and extend outward from the body, typical of many songbirds. They are proportionate to the bird's overall size, which appears small and compact. The tail feathers are relatively short compared to some other bird species, ending in a pointed shape.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The combination of the bright orange-red wings and the deep blue head is unique to this species.
