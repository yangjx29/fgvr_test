The underparts are lighter, almost white, which contrasts with the darker upper parts. The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, typical of many passerine birds.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is relatively small to medium-sized, with a slender body and a short, pointed beak. Its wings are proportionally long compared to its body, and the tail is short and square-cut.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bird's head, which is rounded and lacks a crest. The eyes are dark and appear alert. The beak is short and slightly curved, adapted for catching insects.\n\n- **Tail**: The tail is short and square-cut, which is characteristic of woodswallows. It is not deeply forked like some other songbirds.\n\n- **Wing Patterns**: The wings have a mottled pattern with shades of brown and gray, blending seamlessly into the body coloration.
