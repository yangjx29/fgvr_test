Here’s a detailed description:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The wings exhibit a gradient of color, starting with a light gray near the body and transitioning to a darker gray towards the tips. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of terns, which helps in waterfowl identification.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are long and pointed, characteristic of terns, which aid in their swift flight over water. The tail feathers are also long and pointed, contributing to their streamlined appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinguishing feature is the black cap on the head, which contrasts sharply with the white underparts. This cap extends down the back of the neck, creating a clean, sharp line. The orange beak with a black tip adds another unique element, as it is a common trait among terns.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The Forster's Tern has a slender build, which is evident in the thin legs and the overall proportions of the body. The legs are a bright orange color, which is another key identifying feature. The bird's posture, perched confidently on a wooden post, showcases its elegant and",

The black cap on the head is smooth and contrasts sharply with the white face. The orange beak and legs have a matte finish, which stands out against the smoother feathers.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is relatively small, with a compact body and long, pointed wings that taper to a fine point. Its tail is also long and narrow, contributing to its streamlined profile. The head is small in proportion to the body, giving it an agile and graceful look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the black cap on the head, which is a defining characteristic of the Forster's Tern.
