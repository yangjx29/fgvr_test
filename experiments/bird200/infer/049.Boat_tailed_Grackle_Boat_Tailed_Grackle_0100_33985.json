Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has a predominantly dark, almost black plumage with iridescent blue-green highlights, especially noticeable on its wings and tail. The head is smooth and glossy, reflecting light in certain angles.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear sleek and well-groomed, with no visible spots or markings other than the subtle iridescence. The beak is short and pointed, which is typical for birds that often forage on the ground or in trees.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is relatively small to medium-sized compared to larger birds like crows. Its body is compact, and its wings are proportionate to its body, ending in a sharp point. The tail is also long and pointed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the iridescent sheen on the feathers, particularly on the wings and tail. This iridescence can vary depending on the angle of light and the time of day. The bird's beak is slender and slightly curved at the tip, aiding in its feeding",
