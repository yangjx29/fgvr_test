These markings are located towards the end of the wings, creating a striking contrast against the predominantly gray plumage. The red and white patches are small, irregularly shaped spots that stand out due to their bright coloration. They appear to be slightly raised, giving them a textured appearance compared to the smoother feathers around them.\n\nThe red and white markings are relatively small in size compared to the overall wing span of the bird. They are positioned at the very tips of the wings, making them easily noticeable when the bird is perched or in flight. This pattern is unique to the species and helps distinguish it from other birds with similar coloration but different wing patterns. The combination of the gray body, black head, and these vivid wing tips creates a visually striking and distinctive appearance.",
            "The tail feathers of the bird in the image are distinctive due to their vibrant yellow and black markings. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The tail feathers feature a striking contrast between bright yellow tips and dark black edges. This coloration is vivid and eye-catching.\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light, which enhances their vividness.\n- **Patterns**: The yellow tips are rounded and extend outward, creating a fan-like appearance when the bird is perched. The black edges are sharp and well-defined, forming a clear boundary with the yellow.\n- **Shape and Size**: The tail feathers are relatively short compared to the body length of the bird. They are broad at the base and taper to pointed tips, contributing to the bird's overall streamlined profile.\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of yellow and black creates a bold pattern that is unique to this species. The distinct coloration helps in distinguishing it from other birds with similar tail shapes.\n\nThese features collectively make the tail feathers a key identifying characteristic of the bird in the image.",
            "The bird in the image has a rounded head with a small, pointed black beak. The head is primarily a light brown color, with a subtle hint of reddish-brown on the top of the head, which is characteristic of the Bohemian Waxwing (Bombycilla garrulus). The texture appears smooth, and there are no visible patterns on the head itself.\n\nThe beak is short and conical, typical for seed-eating birds, and it is black in color. Its size is proportionate to the rest of the body, neither overly large nor small, fitting well within the bird's overall profile.\n\nThe wings are grayish-brown with distinct white patches near the tips, and the tail feathers have yellow-tipped edges, which are also characteristic of the Bohemian Waxwing. These features help distinguish this bird from other similar species such as the Cedar Waxwing (Bombycilla cedrorum), which has a more elongated tail and lacks the yellow-tipped tail feathers. The overall shape of the bird is compact and rounded, further aiding in identification."
