The eye is dark and surrounded by a thin, pale ring, which contrasts with the darker feathers around it. The beak is short, straight, and pointed, typical of nuthatches.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head are smooth and appear slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the white areas. There are no prominent patterns other than the natural coloration and the subtle contrast between the white and grayish-blue areas.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is small and rounded, fitting the overall compact body shape of the nuthatch. The beak is proportionally large compared to the head, which is characteristic of this species, aiding in their ability to crack open seeds and insects.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The White-breasted Nuthatch has a distinctive crest on top of its head, though it may not always be fully raised.
