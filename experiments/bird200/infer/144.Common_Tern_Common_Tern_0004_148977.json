The eye is dark, surrounded by a thin white ring, which is typical of many tern species. The beak is slender and pointed, with a slight downward curve at the tip, characteristic of terns. The texture appears smooth and sleek, consistent with the plumage of a tern. There are no visible spots or additional markings on the head, making it a relatively simple yet striking feature for identification. The size of the head relative to the body is proportionate, with the head being smaller than the body but still prominent due to the bird's overall small stature. This combination of features—black cap, white face, slender beak, and smooth texture—is unique to certain tern species and helps distinguish them from other seabirds.",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a Common Tern (Sterna hirundo). Here's a detailed focus on the wingtips and tail feathers:\n\n- **Color**: The wingtips and tail feathers are primarily dark gray, which contrasts with the lighter gray body. The tips of the primary feathers have a slight white or pale gray coloration, creating a subtle pattern.\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, typical of terns, which helps them glide through the air efficiently.\n- **Shape and Size**: The wingtips are pointed and elongated, characteristic of terns, which aids in their swift flight over water. The tail is forked, with two long central feathers and shorter outer ones, also typical of terns.\n- **Unique Features**: The forked tail is a distinctive feature of terns, helping to identify them. The overall shape of the wings and body is streamlined for flight.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the Common Tern from other tern species, such as the Arctic Tern, which has more extensive white on the wingtips and a longer, more deeply forked tail.",

Here's a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The bird has a predominantly white underbelly and a gray back and wings. Its head is black with a white stripe extending from the base of the bill through the eye, creating a mask-like appearance. The bill is slender and pointed, typically red at the base with a black tip. The legs are short and dark.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The Common Tern is relatively small compared to larger gulls. It has a long, narrow tail with a forked end, which is a distinctive feature. The wings are pointed and extend far beyond the tail when the bird is in flight.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The black cap on the head, the white stripe through the eye, and the forked tail are key identifying features. The overall streamlined body shape is also characteristic of terns, designed for efficient flight over water.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The Common Tern is often seen wading along the shore or perched on rocks near water bodies. Its behavior and habitat preferences further help in distinguishing it from other tern species.\n\nThis combination of coloration, shape, and behavior makes the"
