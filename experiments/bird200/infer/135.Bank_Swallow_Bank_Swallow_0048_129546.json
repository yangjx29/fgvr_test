The underparts are a lighter shade, almost white, contrasting with the darker back and wings.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers have a smooth texture, and there are subtle streaks or bars on the back and wings, which are characteristic of Bank Swallows. The head has a clean, unmarked appearance, which helps in distinguishing it from other swallow species.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is small and rounded, with a short, pointed beak. The overall body shape is streamlined, adapted for swift flight, which is common among swallows.\n- **Unique Features**: The Bank Swallow's eyes are dark and round, giving it an alert expression. The wings are long and narrow, tapering to a point, which is essential for their aerial maneuvers.\n\nThese features collectively make the Bank Swallow easily recognizable in the image.",

Here's a detailed description focusing on the wing patterns and tail shape:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**:\n   - The bird has a predominantly dark brown upper body with lighter underparts, which is typical for many swallow species.\n   - The wings have a darker, almost blackish coloration near the tips, transitioning to a lighter brown towards the base. This pattern helps in distinguishing it from other swallow species with more uniform wing colors.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**:\n   - The wings are long and pointed, which is characteristic of swallows, aiding in their swift flight and maneuverability.\n   - The tail is forked into three to five narrow, pointed segments, a feature that is quite distinctive among swallow species and helps in identification.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - The forked tail is particularly notable as it is a key identifying feature of swallows, especially those in the Riparia genus.\n   - The overall streamlined body shape is adapted for rapid flight and agile movements, which are essential for catching insects in mid-air.\n\n4. **Variations or Special Characteristics",
