The black feathers have a glossy sheen, while the white and gray feathers appear more matte. The texture of the feathers is fine and closely packed.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively small compared to the body, which is typical for many songbirds. The wingtips are pointed and extend slightly beyond the tail when the bird is perched.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The wing pattern includes a series of black bars across the upper wing (primaries), with white edges that create a striking contrast. There is also a noticeable white patch near the base of the wing, which is bordered by black feathers. This pattern is distinct and helps in identifying the species.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The wing pattern is consistent throughout the visible portion of the wing. The black bars are evenly spaced, and the white patches are well-defined. This uniformity in the pattern is crucial for accurate identification.\n\nThis wing pattern, combined with the bird's overall coloration (gray head, yellow underparts, and black-and-white striped back), suggests",

This coloration is consistent across all visible tail feathers, suggesting uniformity in their structure and function. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of many bird species. There are no unique markings or patterns on the tail feathers that stand out distinctly from other tail feather types, as they blend seamlessly into the overall plumage without any additional distinguishing features.
