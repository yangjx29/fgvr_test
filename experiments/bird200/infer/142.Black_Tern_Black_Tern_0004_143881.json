Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The head is dark gray, almost black, with a smooth texture. The body is a lighter gray, also appearing smooth. The wings are primarily white with some darker tips, which are more visible due to the motion blur indicating flight.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a slender, streamlined body typical of terns, with a long, pointed beak that is slightly open, revealing a pinkish interior. Its wings are relatively long and narrow, tapering towards the tip, which is characteristic of terns.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the forked tail, which is clearly visible in the image. This is a key identifying trait of terns. Additionally, the bird's posture, with its wings outstretched and body angled, suggests it is in flight.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The Common Tern is known for its graceful flight and often seen hovering over water, which aligns with the posture captured in this image.
