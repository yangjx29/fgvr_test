The throat and upper breast are a bright yellow, while the lower breast and belly are a more olive-green. The wings have a striking pattern: they are dark brown with white wing bars and a prominent white stripe along the edge of the wing.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird has a compact body with a short, pointed beak, typical of warblers.

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The bird has a vibrant yellow underbelly with black streaks, transitioning to a greenish-yellow back and wings. The head is marked with a bold black stripe over the eye and a yellow crown, which contrasts sharply with the black cap. The texture of the feathers is smooth and glossy, typical of warblers.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is small and compact, with a slender body and a short, pointed beak. Its size is consistent with other warblers, being relatively small compared to larger songbirds like thrushes.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the combination of the black and yellow plumage, particularly the black stripe over the eye and the yellow crown. The black cap on the head further aids in identification. The beak is thin and pointed, suitable for probing into leaves and flowers for insects.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The Cape May Warbler is known for its striking appearance, especially during breeding season when it displays its full plumage.
