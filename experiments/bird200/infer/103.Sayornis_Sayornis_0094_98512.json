The neck and upper chest are a lighter shade of brown, transitioning into a white belly. The wings are dark brown with a slight sheen, and the tail is also dark brown.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and well-defined, with a slight glossiness, especially noticeable on the wings.
