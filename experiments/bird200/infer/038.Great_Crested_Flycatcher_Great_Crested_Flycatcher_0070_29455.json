The wings are darker green with subtle brownish streaking near the tips, which is characteristic of the species. The tail is long and slightly forked, with a mix of green and brown tones.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird's overall shape is slender and elongated, typical of flycatchers. It has a relatively long, pointed bill that is slightly curved downward, which is adapted for catching insects in flight. The size is medium, larger than a sparrow but smaller than a robin.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the crest on the head, which is not always visible but can be seen in certain lighting conditions. This crest is short and rounded. Another unique feature is the white stripe above the eye, which is clearly visible in this image.\n\n4. **Tail Feathers**: The tail is long and slightly forked, with a mix of green and brown tones.
