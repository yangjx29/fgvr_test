The elongated body, exceptionally long wings, and streamlined form are all indicative of albatrosses.

Additionally, the short, stout beak with a slightly curved shape is consistent with this species. The similarity score also supports this classification, with the Black-footed Albatross having the highest score among the candidates. | Key Features: ['Elongated body', 'Exceptionally long wings', 'Dark brown plumage with lighter underparts', 'Short, stout beak with a slightly curved shape'] | Uncertainty: ['The image quality and resolution may affect the accuracy of the classification.']",

It is a light grayish color, which blends subtly into the head's darker tones. The size of the head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of many seabird species. There are no distinctive markings or features on the head that set it apart from other similar birds, but the overall coloration and beak shape suggest it could belong to a species adapted for diving or fishing in the ocean.",

The wingtips appear slightly darker than the rest of the wing, possibly indicating a subtle color gradient or wear. The texture of the wings seems smooth and slightly glossy, suggesting they are well-adapted for flight.\n\nThe tail feathers are long and thin, extending downward in a straight line, which is characteristic of seabirds like albatrosses. They are dark in color, contrasting with the lighter body of the bird. The tail feathers are relatively uniform in width and length, contributing to the bird's overall sleek profile.\n\nThe bird's head is rounded with a short, stout beak that is light-colored, possibly white or pale gray. The eye is dark and appears to be surrounded by a lighter ring, which is typical of many seabird species. The body of the bird is mostly dark, possibly black or very dark brown, with a lighter underbelly that is not clearly visible in this image due to the angle and lighting.\n\nOverall, the combination of the long wings, slender tail, and dark coloration with lighter underparts makes this bird distinct from other seabirds, particularly those with shorter wingspans or more robust builds",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a large seabird, likely a petrel or albatross, given its long wingspan and streamlined body. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color, Texture, and Patterns**: The bird has a predominantly dark brown plumage with lighter underparts, particularly noticeable around the neck and belly. The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, typical of seabirds adapted for water. There are no distinct patterns, but the coloration provides excellent camouflage against the ocean backdrop.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Wingspan**: The wings are exceptionally long and narrow, extending far beyond the length of the body. This is characteristic of birds designed for gliding over water, such as albatrosses. The wings appear broad at the base and taper towards the tips, which helps in efficient flight over long distances.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The bird's most striking feature is its long, slender wings, which dominate its overall appearance. Its head is relatively small compared to its wings, with a short, pointed beak that is likely adapted for catching fish or squid. The tail is short and rounded, aiding in maneuverability during flight.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The bird's body is compact and"
