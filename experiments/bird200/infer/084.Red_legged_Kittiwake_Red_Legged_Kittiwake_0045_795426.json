The wing tips are relatively small compared to the overall body size of the bird, which is typical for many seabird species. The edges of the wing tips are sharp and well-defined, contributing to the bird's streamlined profile. There are no visible variations or special characteristics in the wing tips that set them apart from other similar categories, as they conform to the common patterns found in gulls and similar birds.",

The feet are small and conical, typical of seabirds, and they are also reddish-orange, matching the legs.\n\nThe bird's body is primarily white with gray wings and a black tail. The head is mostly white with a small yellow beak. The overall size of the legs and feet is proportionate to the bird's body, which is relatively small and compact. The reddish-orange coloration of the legs and feet is a distinctive feature that helps distinguish this bird from others, such as gulls, which often have gray or black legs and feet. The smooth texture and lack of any additional markings further contribute to the bird's unique appearance."
