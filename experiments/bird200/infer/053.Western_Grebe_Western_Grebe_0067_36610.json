The head is mostly black with a prominent white stripe running from the base of the bill through the eye, creating a striking contrast. The bill itself is long, slender, and yellowish-orange.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the back and wings have a slightly glossy appearance, reflecting light and giving them a smooth texture. The wing patterns include a mix of dark and lighter shades, with some subtle mottling visible, especially near the edges of the wings. The underwing is lighter, almost white, which helps in distinguishing it from the darker upper parts.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are broad and rounded, typical of grebes, which are designed for efficient swimming rather than flying. The size of the wings relative to the body is moderate, neither too large nor too small, allowing for effective maneuvering in water.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the white stripe on the",

The head has a striking black cap, which contrasts sharply with the lighter neck and chest.\n   - The back and wings display a mottled pattern of dark and light gray, giving it a speckled appearance.\n   - The beak is long, slender, and yellowish-orange, which is a key identifying feature.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**:\n   - The Western Grebe has a streamlined body shape adapted for swimming, with a relatively small head and a long neck.\n   - Its body is compact and rounded, with a short tail visible at the rear end.\n   - The wings are broad and slightly rounded, which is typical for grebes.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - The most distinctive feature is the bright yellow-orange beak, which is longer than that of many other waterfowl species.\n   - The black cap on the head is another unique characteristic, setting it apart from other grebe species"
