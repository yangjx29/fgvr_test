Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The beak is bright red with a black tip, which contrasts sharply against the white body. The head is predominantly black, creating a stark contrast with the white underparts.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The beak has a smooth, glossy texture, typical of many seabirds. The black area at the tip of the beak appears slightly darker and more matte compared to the rest of the beak. The head is uniformly black without any visible patterns.\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is long and slender, characteristic of terns, and tapers to a point. It is relatively short compared to the bird's overall length, which is consistent with the tern's streamlined body shape designed for efficient flight over water.\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the bright red beak with a black tip and the black head is unique to terns among seabirds. This coloration helps distinguish it from other similar-looking birds such as gulls, which typically have gray or white heads and beaks.\n- **Special Characteristics**: The tern's wings are outstretched, showcasing their long, pointed shape,",
            "The bird in the image has wings that are predominantly white with subtle grayish tones near the tips, indicating a slight variation in coloration typical of some tern species. The wing structure is broad and slightly rounded at the tips, which is characteristic of many seabirds, aiding in their flight over water. The tail is long and forked, extending beyond the wings, a feature common among terns, which helps in maneuverability during flight.\n\nThe texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light, which is typical for feathers that need to be aerodynamic and waterproof. There are no distinct patterns visible on the wings, suggesting a plain coloration that may serve as camouflage against the sky and water.\n\nThe overall shape of the wings is large compared to the body, which is consistent with the bird's need for efficient gliding and soaring over water bodies. The tail's length and forked shape are particularly distinctive, helping to identify the bird as a tern. These features, combined with the red beak and black cap, make it a clear example of a tern species, distinguishing it from other seabirds like gulls or auks.",
