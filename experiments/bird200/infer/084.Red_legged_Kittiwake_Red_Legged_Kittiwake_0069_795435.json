There are no visible patterns or markings on the head, maintaining a clean and simple look.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is relatively short and stout compared to some other bird species, with a slight curve at the tip. It is proportionate to the head, neither too large nor too small, fitting well within the overall structure of the bird's head.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the bright orange coloration of the beak, which is a distinctive characteristic of many gull species. This vibrant color stands out against the white head and the darker wing tips, making it easily recognizable.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The bird's head and beak are typical of gulls, which often have a combination of white plumage and brightly colored beaks.

The wings have a grayish tone, which contrasts with the white body. The tail feathers are also gray, blending into the wing pattern. The legs are a bright red-orange, a common feature in many gull species.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear soft and slightly fluffy, typical of gulls. The wingtips have a darker, almost black appearance, indicating the presence of secondary flight feathers. The underwing patterns are not clearly visible due to the angle and lighting, but generally, gulls have a darker leading edge and lighter trailing edge on their wings.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a robust, streamlined body shape typical of seabirds, with a broad wingspan that aids in gliding over water. Its head is small compared to its body, with a pointed beak that is slightly open, revealing a pinkish interior.
