The size of the beak is proportionate to the body, being neither overly large nor small for its species.\n\nDistinctive features include the blue coloration at the base of the beak, which is not common among all seabirds and can be used to identify certain species. There are no visible patterns or markings on the beak itself, making the color and shape the most notable characteristics. The beak's structure suggests it is adapted for catching fish and other aquatic prey, which aligns with the bird's likely diet and habitat.",

There are no visible patterns or distinct markings around the eye, which suggests it may blend seamlessly into the dark plumage of the bird's head. The eye itself is not particularly large, indicating it might be adapted for its environment, possibly for camouflage or to reduce drag while swimming. The lack of any bright or contrasting colors makes it a subtle feature, typical of many seabirds that rely on their dark coloration for protection against predators.",

Here's a detailed description of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has predominantly dark plumage, with a glossy black coloration covering most of its body. The neck area displays a lighter shade, possibly grayish-blue, which contrasts with the darker feathers. The beak is long and slightly curved, with a blue patch visible near the base, adding a distinctive feature.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and compact, typical of birds adapted for aquatic life. There are no visible patterns or markings other than the subtle color gradients mentioned above.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is relatively small compared to some larger seabirds like albatrosses, but it is robust and compact. Its wings are short and broad, which is characteristic of cormorants, aiding in their ability to maneuver in water. The head is rounded, and the neck is short and thick.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most noticeable feature is the blue patch on the lower part of the beak, which is a distinctive trait among certain cormorant"
