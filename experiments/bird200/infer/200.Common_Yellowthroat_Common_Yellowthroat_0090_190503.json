The head is a mix of olive-green and black, with a black cap and a white throat patch. The beak is short and pointed, predominantly black with a slight yellowish tint near the base. The legs are thin and appear to be a light brownish-gray.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The Common Yellowthroat is small, with an average length of about 12 cm (4.7 inches). Its body is compact and rounded, typical of warblers. The wings are relatively short compared to other songbirds, and the tail is short and square-cut.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap on the head, which sharply contrasts with the yellow underparts. The white throat patch is another key identifying characteristic.
