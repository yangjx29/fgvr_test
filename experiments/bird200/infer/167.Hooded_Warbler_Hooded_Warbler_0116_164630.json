The shape of the head is rounded, with a small, pointed beak that is slightly curved downward. The size of the head relative to the body is proportionate, fitting well within the overall compact form of the bird.

The wingtips are slightly rounded, and the wing feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light in certain areas. The wing size is proportional to the bird's overall body size, which is compact and rounded. The unique black hood, combined with the bright yellow throat and breast, sets it apart from other warbler species. The bird's eye is a striking yellow, adding to its distinctive appearance.
