It is proportionally large relative to the bird's head, which is typical for Horned Larks. The beak curves slightly downward at the tip, aiding in seed-eating behavior.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinguishing feature is the presence of two small, horn-like structures on top of the head, which give the bird its name \"Horned Lark.\" These structures are not visible in this particular image due to the angle and lighting, but they are a key identifying trait.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: The beak's coloration and shape are consistent with Horned Larks, but slight variations in color intensity or beak curvature might occur among individuals within the same species.
