The beak is short and conical, typical of seed-eating birds, and appears to be a light grayish-brown color. The overall size of the head is proportionate to the rest of the body, which is consistent with the bird's small stature. The head's shape is rounded at the top, tapering down to the beak.

Its wing patterns are notable for their intricate coloration and texture:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The wings display a mix of brown, gray, and white feathers. The brown feathers have a slightly iridescent sheen, especially noticeable near the tips, giving them a subtle metallic appearance. The gray feathers are more uniform in color but also have a fine texture that suggests they are slightly softer than the brown ones.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively small compared to the bird's body, typical of sparrows. They are broad and rounded at the tips, with the primary feathers showing a slight curve when viewed from the side.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the white throat patch, which is bordered by two black stripes. This pattern is unique to the White-throated Sparrow and helps in distinguishing it from other sparrow species. Additionally, the yellow stripe above each eye adds another layer of identification.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The wing patterns can show some variation among individuals, but the overall",
