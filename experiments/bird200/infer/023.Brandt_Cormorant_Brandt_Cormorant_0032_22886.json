There is a subtle gradient where the neck transitions into the body, which is slightly lighter but still dark.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, with a long, slender beak that curves slightly downward. The neck is short and thick, supporting the head.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most noticeable feature is the large, wide wings that are partially spread, revealing a darker coloration with some lighter, possibly grayish, feathers near the tips. The legs are short and dark, and the feet are webbed, typical of aquatic birds.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The cormorant's eyes are small and dark, positioned towards the front of the head, which is characteristic of many seabirds. The overall shape of the head and beak is streamlined, aiding in swimming and diving.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the bird as a cormorant, particularly when compared to other seabirds like gulls or pelicans.",

The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light subtly, which suggests a healthy, well-maintained feather structure. The wings are relatively large compared to the body, indicating they are designed for efficient flight. The shape is broad and rounded, typical of birds adapted for diving and swimming, such as cormorants. There are no distinct patterns or markings on the wingtips; they are uniformly colored. The wingtips are slightly curved downward, which is characteristic of birds that spend significant time in water, aiding in their streamlined movement through the air and water. Overall, the wingtips are a consistent dark brown color with a smooth texture and a broad, rounded shape.",

Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The bird is predominantly dark, with a glossy black appearance on its head, neck, and back. The wings have a slightly lighter shade, possibly a dark brown or gray, which contrasts subtly with the darker areas. The tail is not prominently visible but seems to match the overall dark coloration.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and compact, typical of cormorants, which helps them maintain buoyancy in water. There are no visible patterns or markings on the body; it is uniformly dark.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a streamlined body, adapted for swimming, with a long, narrow beak that curves slightly downward. Its wings are broad and rounded at the tips, which are characteristic of cormorants. The size relative to the rock suggests it is an adult, as cormorants can grow quite large.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bird's head shape, which is relatively small compared to its body and has a slightly flattened appearance.
