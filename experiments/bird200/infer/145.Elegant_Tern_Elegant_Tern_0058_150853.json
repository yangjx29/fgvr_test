The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of many seabirds. The size of the head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of many wading birds. There are no visible patterns or additional markings on the head beyond the black stripe.

Here's a detailed breakdown of its wing patterns and tail feathers:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**:\n   - The wings are primarily white with dark gray or black tips, creating a striking contrast. The coloration is smooth and glossy, typical of terns, which helps them blend into their marine environment.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**:\n   - The wings are long and narrow, extending far beyond the body when the bird is in flight. This shape is adapted for efficient gliding over water surfaces.\n   - The tail feathers are short and forked, a common feature among terns, aiding in maneuverability during flight and diving.\n\n3. **Unique Features**:\n   - The yellow-orange bill is a prominent feature, with a black tip that adds to the bird's distinctive appearance.\n   - The overall body shape is streamlined, with a long neck and slender legs, all of which are adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**:\n   - The white underparts contrast sharply with the darker upper parts, a pattern often seen in terns to help with camouflage",

Its head is adorned with a distinctive crest of dark feathers, which stands upright, giving it a striking appearance. The beak is long, slender, and yellowish-orange, with a black tip.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the white parts of the body. The wingtips and tail have a more textured look, with darker, almost black feathers that contrast sharply with the white body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is relatively small compared to larger waterfowl like ducks. Its body is streamlined, with a long neck and a compact head. The wings are long and narrow, tapering to a point, which is typical for birds designed for swift flight over water.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the crest on the head, which is raised and adds to the bird's alert and elegant appearance.
