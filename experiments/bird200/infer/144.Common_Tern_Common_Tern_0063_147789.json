The beak is short and pointed, with a slight curve at the tip, which is characteristic of terns. It appears to be a light grayish color, contrasting with the black cap. The eye is dark, likely black, and small in proportion to the head. The head is relatively small compared to the body, and the black cap is smooth and lacks any visible patterns or textures. The overall shape of the head is rounded, typical of many seabirds. There are no visible variations or special characteristics in the head and beak area that set it apart from other tern species; however, the combination of the black cap, white body, and short, curved beak is distinctive for terns.",

The texture appears smooth, typical of a bird's feathered surface. The wings are outstretched, showcasing their length and the slight curve at the tips, which are slightly darker than the rest of the wing. The tail feathers are also white, with a slight fan-like appearance as they extend downward, adding to the bird's streamlined profile.\n\nThe wingtips and tail feathers are relatively long compared to the body, contributing to the bird's overall graceful flight posture. There are no visible patterns or markings on these parts, making them appear uniform in color and texture. The edges of the wings and tail are slightly rounded, indicating a smooth transition between the feathers. This combination of features—long, white, and subtly patterned feathers—helps distinguish this bird from others with shorter or differently colored wingtips and tail feathers.",
            "The bird in the image appears to be a tern, characterized by its slender build and long, pointed wings. Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color**: The bird is predominantly white with black markings. The head and neck are black, contrasting sharply with the white body and wings. The legs are orange-red, adding another distinct color element.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, typical of many seabirds. There are no visible patterns other than the stark contrast between the black and white plumage.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a streamlined body with a long, narrow tail and elongated wings. Its wings are outstretched, showcasing their length and pointed tips. The overall size suggests it is a medium-sized bird, likely a common tern (Sterna hirundo).\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap on the head, which is a hallmark of terns. The orange-red legs are also unique and help in identification. The bird's posture, with wings fully extended, suggests it might be in flight or preparing to land.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The tern's wings are particularly notable for their length and pointed shape, which are adaptations for efficient flight over water.
