Here's a detailed description focusing on the head and eye region:\n\n1. **Color**: The head is predominantly olive-green with a slightly darker shade around the eyes. The feathers have a subtle sheen, giving them a slightly glossy appearance.\n\n2. **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head are smooth and appear slightly ruffled, which is common in birds when they are perched. There are no distinct patterns on the head itself; it is a solid color with a smooth texture.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The head is small and rounded, typical of many flycatchers. The eye is dark and round, surrounded by a thin white ring, which is characteristic of this species. The eye is relatively large compared to the overall size of the head.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most distinctive feature is the white ring around the eye, which is a key identifier for flycatchers.
