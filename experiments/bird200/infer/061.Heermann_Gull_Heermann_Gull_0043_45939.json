The eye is small and dark, surrounded by a thin ring of pinkish skin, adding to the bird's unique appearance.\n\nThe head is relatively small compared to the body, which is covered in gray feathers. The overall shape of the head is rounded at the top, tapering down to the beak. There are no visible patterns or markings on the head other than the subtle color variation around the eye. The beak is proportionate to the head, neither too long nor too short, and it curves slightly downward at the tip, which is characteristic of gulls and similar birds. This combination of features—white head, pinkish eye ring, and short, pointed beak—helps distinguish this bird from other similar seabirds.",

The wing patterns display a gradient of color, with the leading edge being darker gray and transitioning to lighter shades towards the tips. The feathers have a slightly textured appearance, with some showing subtle variations in hue and density.\n\nThe wing shape is broad and rounded, typical of seagulls, which helps in distinguishing it from smaller birds like gulls. The tail is short and dark, contrasting with the lighter body. The beak is orange with a black tip, adding another distinctive feature.\n\nThe bird's posture, perched on a rocky surface, further emphasizes its robust build and the overall structure of its wings and tail. The background of rocks and greenery provides a natural setting that complements the bird's environment.",
