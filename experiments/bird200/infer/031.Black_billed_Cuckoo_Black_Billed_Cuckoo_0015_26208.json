The eyes are a striking red-orange, which is quite distinctive and helps in identification. The beak is short and slightly curved downward, characteristic of cuckoos.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head appear smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light in certain areas. There are no prominent patterns other than the subtle color gradients mentioned above.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is relatively short and stout compared to some other bird species, with a slight downward curve at the tip. This shape is typical for cuckoos, aiding in their feeding habits.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinguishing feature is the bright red-orange eye color, which is unique among cuckoos and sets it apart from other similar species.
