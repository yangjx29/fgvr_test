The face has a pale, creamy-yellow patch around the eye, which contrasts sharply with the darker plumage. The beak is long, slender, and slightly curved downward at the tip, characteristic of cuckoos.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head have a fine, soft texture, typical of many bird species. There are no distinct patterns visible on the head apart from the color gradients and the yellow facial patch.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is elongated and pointed, with a slight downward curve at the tip, which is a key feature distinguishing cuckoos from other birds. The overall head shape is rounded, with a small, compact appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the yellow facial patch, which is a hallmark of the Yellow-billed Cuckoo.
