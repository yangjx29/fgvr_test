The tail feathers are primarily black with white streaks running vertically along their length, creating a striped effect. The lower back area also displays a similar pattern, with black feathers interspersed with white markings. This pattern is consistent across the visible portion of the tail and lower back.\n\nThe texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of many woodpecker species. The black feathers have a rich, deep color, while the white markings are bright and stand out sharply against the darker background. There are no other colors present in these areas, making the contrast very pronounced.\n\nThe shape of the tail feathers is elongated and narrow, characteristic of woodpeckers, which they use for probing into tree bark. The size of the tail relative to the body is proportionate, aiding in balance and maneuverability when perched or flying.\n\nNo other distinctive features or variations are apparent in the tail and lower back area of this bird, as the focus is on the clear, bold pattern of black and white.

It is perched on a tree trunk covered with lichen, providing a natural backdrop that highlights its striking coloration. The bird's body is compact, with a short, pointed beak suited for pecking into tree bark. Its eyes are dark and alert, and the overall posture suggests it is actively foraging or observing its surroundings.\n\n#### Head and Neck Area:\nThe head and neck area of the bird display a bold pattern of black and white stripes. The top of the head is predominantly black with a subtle hint of yellowish-brown near the beak, which is short and pointed. The neck area shows a mix of black and white stripes, creating a strong contrast against the darker background of the head.
