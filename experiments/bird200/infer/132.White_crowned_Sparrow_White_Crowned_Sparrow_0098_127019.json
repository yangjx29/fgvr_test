The body is primarily grayish-brown with subtle streaking, and the wings have white and brown bars. The tail is short and rounded.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird appears small and compact, typical of sparrows. Its beak is short and conical, suitable for seed-eating.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black-and-white striped head pattern, which is unique to the White-crowned Sparrow. This marking is quite striking and helps in distinguishing it from other sparrow species.\n\n- **Variations**: While the basic coloration is consistent, there can be slight variations in the intensity of the stripes and the overall tone of the plumage.

They are proportionate to the body size, which is small to medium for a sparrow.\n\n3. **Unique Features**:\n   - **Wing Bars**: The most distinctive feature is the series of white bars across the wings. These bars are irregularly spaced and vary in width, creating a pattern that is unique to the White-crowned Sparrow.\n   - **Tail**: The tail is short and square, with a slight upward curve at the tip.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**:\n   - The wing bars can sometimes appear as a single white stripe along the edge of the wing, depending on the angle and lighting.\n   - The head has a black-and-white striped pattern, which is not directly related to the wing patterns but is another identifying feature of the species.\n\nThese wing patterns, combined with the",
