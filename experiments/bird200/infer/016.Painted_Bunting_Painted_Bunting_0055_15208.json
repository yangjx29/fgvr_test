Here's a breakdown of its wing patterns and tail feathers:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**: The bird's body is predominantly a vibrant green, with a slightly darker shade on the back and wings. The underparts are a lighter, more yellowish-green. The texture seems smooth and glossy, typical of many passerine birds.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively short and broad compared to the length of the body.

The edges of the wings appear slightly darker than the rest of the body, which could be due to feather tips or a slight variation in coloration.\n   - The tail feathers are short and rounded, blending seamlessly into the body without any prominent tail streamers or notches.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**:\n   - The green tanager typically has a bright green coloration, especially in males during breeding season.
