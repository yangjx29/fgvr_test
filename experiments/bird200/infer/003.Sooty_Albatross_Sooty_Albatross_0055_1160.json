It is relatively large compared to the body, which is common among seabirds.\n\n2. **Body**:\n   - **Color**: The body is predominantly dark brown, with a slightly lighter shade on the underparts.

            "The bird in the image appears to be a Black-footed Albatross (Phoebastria nigripes). Here's a detailed description focusing on wing patterns and tail shape:\n\n1. **Color and Texture**:\n   - The wings are primarily dark brown with subtle lighter streaks and mottling, especially noticeable near the tips. The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, typical of albatross feathers.\n\n2. **Wing Patterns**:\n   - The wings have a distinct pattern where the leading edge is darker than the trailing edge. This gradient is more pronounced towards the tips, which are slightly lighter.\n   - There are no prominent white patches or bright markings on the wings, which helps distinguish it from other albatross species like the Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) that has white wingtips.\n\n3. **Tail Shape**:\n   - The tail is short and rounded, with a slight fork at the end. It is not deeply forked as seen in some other seabirds like shearwaters.\n\n4. **Unique Features**:\n   - The Black-footed Albatross has a robust body with a large head and a relatively short neck. Its legs are black and short, ending",
            "The bird in the image has dark brown feathers covering most of its body, with a slightly lighter shade on its head and neck. Its legs are black and appear sturdy, supporting its weight as it stands on the ground. The legs have a smooth texture and are relatively short compared to the bird's body.\n\nA notable feature is the presence of a small, white marking near the base of one leg, which could be a unique identifier or a natural variation. This marking contrasts with the otherwise uniform dark coloration of the legs.\n\nThe bird's beak is short and stout, with a dark color that matches its overall plumage. The eye appears dark, blending into the head's coloration, making it less distinct.\n\nThese characteristics—dark brown feathers, black legs with a white marking, and a short, dark beak—are distinctive and help differentiate this bird from others in similar categories, such as gulls or terns, which typically have lighter-colored plumage and different leg colors."
