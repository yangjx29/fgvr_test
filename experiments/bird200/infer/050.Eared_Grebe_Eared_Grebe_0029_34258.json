The back and wings display a mottled pattern of darker and lighter shades, giving it a speckled appearance.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear soft and slightly fluffy, especially noticeable around the neck and chest area. This texture is typical for grebes, aiding in insulation and buoyancy.\n\n- **Patterns**: The most distinctive feature is the stark contrast between the dark neck and the lighter head and upper body. There are no prominent stripes or spots, but the overall pattern is subtle and natural, blending well with the water environment.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is relatively small compared to the body, which is characteristic of grebes.
