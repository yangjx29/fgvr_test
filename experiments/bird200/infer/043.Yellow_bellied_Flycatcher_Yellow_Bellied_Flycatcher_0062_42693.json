Its wings have a subtle pattern of darker streaks and bars, which are more noticeable when the bird is in flight. The tail is relatively short and square-shaped, with a slight upward curve at the tip.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is small, fitting comfortably within the branches of the tree. Its head is rounded, and it has a short, pointed beak typical of insectivorous birds. The wings are proportionally long compared to its body, aiding in agile flight.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the wing pattern. The dark streaking and barring on the wings are quite characteristic of flycatchers. Additionally, the bird's posture, perched on a branch, allows for a clear view of these markings.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The bird's plumage shows a mix of green and yellow tones, which can vary depending on the lighting and time of year.
