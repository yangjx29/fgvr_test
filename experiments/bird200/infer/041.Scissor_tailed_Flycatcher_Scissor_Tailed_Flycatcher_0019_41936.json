The wings exhibit a mix of dark gray and white, with noticeable black streaks and spots, creating a patterned appearance. The tail is long and forked, with a central stripe of white feathers.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively broad and rounded, with a noticeable contrast between the darker upper parts and the lighter underparts. The tail is particularly striking, being long and deeply forked, which is a key identifying feature of the Scissor-tailed Flycatcher.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the long, forked tail, which is a hallmark of this species. Additionally, the bird's head is light gray with a subtle hint of orange near the base of the tail, adding a touch of color to its otherwise muted tones.\n\n4. **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The Scissor-tailed Flycatcher is known for its unique tail, which it uses for display during courtship and territorial displays.
