The neck and upper chest are also dark gray, while the lower chest and belly are white with black speckles. The wings have a mix of dark and light feathers, creating a mottled pattern.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The Least Auklet is small, with a compact body and short, thick bill.

Here's a detailed description:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The Least Auklet has a predominantly black upper body with white underparts. The wings exhibit a complex pattern of black and white bars, which are more pronounced near the tips. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of seabirds.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is small, with a compact body and short, rounded wings. Its beak is short and pointed, adapted for catching fish. The overall size is consistent with other auklets, smaller than gulls but larger than many songbirds.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Least Auklet has a small, dark eye and a short, stout beak. Its legs are short and dark, blending well with its plumage. The most distinctive feature is the barred pattern on the wings, which is unique among auklets and helps in distinguishing it from other similar species like the Common Murre.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The Least Auklet can vary slightly in color intensity, with some individuals appearing darker or lighter depending on their age and time of year.
