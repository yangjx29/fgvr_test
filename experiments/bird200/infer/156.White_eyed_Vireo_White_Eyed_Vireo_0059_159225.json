It is relatively small compared to the body, fitting proportionally well with the overall size of the bird.\n\nThe head is rounded and compact, with a smooth texture that lacks any visible feathers or downy areas. This smoothness contributes to the bird's streamlined appearance. There are no distinct markings or spots on the head, making it appear uniform in coloration except for the eye-ring and the subtle gradient of green shades.\n\nThe beak is straight and slightly curved at the tip, typical of insectivorous birds that often use their beaks to probe into crevices or pick insects off leaves. The texture of the beak seems smooth and slightly glossy, indicating a healthy condition.\n\nOverall, these visual characteristics—olive-green plumage, yellowish eye-rings, short grayish beak, and smooth texture—are distinctive and help distinguish this bird from other similar categories, particularly",
