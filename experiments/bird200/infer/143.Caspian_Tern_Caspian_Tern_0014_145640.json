The beak is relatively short and pointed, typical of many terns, but the red coloration with the black tip is unique. This combination of colors is particularly noticeable against the white plumage of the bird's head and neck. The texture appears smooth, consistent with the beak of a tern, and there are no visible patterns or markings on the beak itself. The size of the beak is proportionate to the bird's head, neither overly large nor small, fitting the general morphology of terns. There are no additional variations or special features on the beak that stand out; it is a simple, solid-colored structure that serves as a clear identifier for this particular species among terns.",

Its plumage is predominantly white, with a black cap on the head extending down the back of the neck. The wings are long and narrow, with a dark gray leading edge and a lighter gray or white trailing edge. The tail is slender and forked, adding to the bird's graceful silhouette. The beak is long, slender, and slightly curved downward, colored red with a black tip, which is a distinctive feature of the Caspian Tern.\n\n#### Beak Area:\nThe beak is a key identifier for this bird. It is long, slender, and slightly curved downward, with a bright red coloration that transitions to a black tip. This combination of red and black is characteristic of the Caspian Tern, distinguishing it from other tern species. The texture of the beak appears smooth, consistent with the typical beak structure of terns, and there are no visible patterns or markings on the beak itself.\n\n#### Wingtips:\nThe wings are long and narrow, with a dark gray leading edge and a lighter gray or white trailing edge.
