The beak is short and pointed, typical of warblers, and appears dark brown. The overall size of the bird is small, consistent with warbler species. The head and upper chest area are particularly striking due to the bold contrast between the black and yellow colors, making it easily identifiable as a Cape May Warbler (Setophaga tigrina).",

These tips form a series of horizontal stripes across the wing, creating a striped appearance. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of many songbird species.\n\nThe wings are relatively large compared to the bird's body, indicating their importance in flight. The feathers are arranged in a fan-like pattern when the wing is folded, showcasing the intricate arrangement necessary for flight efficiency. There are no visible spots or additional patterns within the stripes; the stripes are uniform in width and spacing.\n\nThe wing feathers' shape is elongated and slightly pointed at the tips, which is characteristic of many small songbirds. This shape helps in providing lift during flight. The size of the feathers is proportional to the bird's overall size, suggesting they are well-adapted for the bird's flight capabilities.\n\nOverall, the wing feathers are a key feature that contributes to the bird's identification as a Cape May Warbler (Setophaga tigrina), known for its striking yellow plumage and distinctive wing stripe pattern.",

Its back is olive-green with darker streaking, and it has a black cap on its head. The wings have bold black and white bars, which are characteristic of the species.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is compact and rounded, typical of warblers. It is relatively small, with a length of approximately 5-6 inches (13-15 cm) and a wingspan of around 7-8 inches (18-20 cm). This size makes it smaller than many other songbirds.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The black cap on the head, the bright yellow underparts, and the black and white wing bars are key identifying features. The eye is dark and expressive, adding to its distinctive appearance.\n\n4. **Special Characteristics**: The Cape May Warbler is known for its migratory habits, traveling long distances between North America and South America.
