The wings have a gradient from dark gray at the tips to lighter gray near the body, with some white feathers visible near the wingtips.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is small compared to the body, with a pointed beak that is relatively short and stout. The overall body shape is streamlined, adapted for efficient flight over water.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the black head, white body, and bright orange beak with a black tip is unique to the Caspian Tern. No other tern species share this exact coloration pattern.\n\nThese features collectively make the Caspian Tern easily distinguishable from other seabirds and tern species.",

The leading edge of the wing is predominantly black, while the rest of the wing, including the primary feathers, is white. This pattern is characteristic of the Caspian Tern and helps distinguish it from other tern species. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of terns' plumage.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The wings are long and pointed, extending far beyond the body when the bird is in flight. The wingtips are slightly curved, and the overall shape is streamlined for efficient flight over water. The wings are proportionally large compared to the bird's body, which is consistent with the Caspian Tern's size and build.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The Caspian Tern has a slender, forked tail, which is another distinguishing feature. Its beak is bright orange with a black tip, and its legs are black. These features, combined with the wing patterns, make it easily recognizable.\n\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics",
