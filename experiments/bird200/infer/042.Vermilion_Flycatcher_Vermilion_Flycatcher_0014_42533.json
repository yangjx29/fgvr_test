The body transitions into a darker shade of red, becoming more muted towards the belly, which is a lighter, almost salmon-pink color. The wings are dark grayish-black, and the tail is short and also dark. The bird's overall size is small, typical of flycatchers, and it perches confidently on a barbed wire, showcasing its compact yet striking appearance.

The wings are a mix of dark gray and black with subtle white streaks, which are more noticeable towards the tips. The tail is short and square-shaped, also dark gray with a slight reddish hue at the base.\n\nThe Vermillion Flycatcher has a small, pointed beak that is slightly curved downward, typical of insectivorous birds. Its eyes are dark and round, giving it an alert appearance. The overall body shape is compact and streamlined, suitable for agile flight and perching.\n\nThe texture of the feathers appears smooth and glossy, especially on the red parts, which reflect light, enhancing their vivid coloration. The contrast between the bright red and the darker gray and black wings makes the Vermillion Flycatcher easily distinguishable from other flycatchers and similar species.",

Its underparts are a lighter shade of orange, creating a striking contrast with the darker areas. The bird's beak is short and pointed, typical of insectivorous birds, and it has a small, sharp-looking eye.\n\nIn terms of size, the Vermillion Flycatcher is relatively small, with an average length of around 12-14 cm (4.7–5.5 inches). It has a slender build, with a compact body and a short, slightly curved tail.\n\nDistinctive features include:\n- A bright red-orange cap on the head, which extends down the back of the neck.\n- A black stripe running through the eye, which helps to define the eye area.\n- A white throat patch that contrasts sharply with the orange coloration.\n- A short, pointed beak suited for catching insects.\n\nThe texture of the feathers appears smooth and well-groomed, contributing to the bird's overall sleek appearance.
