This white patch is a key feature that distinguishes it from other similar birds. The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light, which enhances the contrast between the dark and white areas.\n\nThe shape of the wings is relatively broad and rounded, typical of many seabirds, which helps in providing stability during flight over water. The size of the wings is proportionate to the body, aiding in efficient gliding and maneuverability. The wingtips are slightly pointed, indicating a design suited for agile flight.\n\nUnique to this bird is the bright red coloration on the legs and feet, which stands out vividly against the darker plumage. This red coloration is not only visually striking but also serves as a distinctive feature that sets it apart from other seabirds. The legs are thin and elongated, ending in sharp claws that are well-adapted for gripping slippery surfaces like rocks or ice.\n\nOverall, the combination of the dark wings with a white patch, the bright red legs, and the overall sleek and streamlined body make this bird easily identifiable and distinct from similar categories of seabird",
