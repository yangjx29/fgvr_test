The predominantly white plumage with subtle hints of pale yellow or cream near the base of the beak and the back of the neck is typical of the Ivory Gull. Additionally, the distinctive black spots on the wingtips are a hallmark feature of this species. The rounded head, short slightly curved beak, and dark eyes further support this identification. The similarity score of 0.3462 also indicates a high likelihood of this being an Ivory Gull. | Key Features: ['Predominantly white plumage with subtle hints of pale yellow or cream near the base of the beak and the back of the neck.', 'Distinctive black spots on the wingtips.', 'Rounded head, short slightly curved beak, and dark eyes.'] | Uncertainty: [\"While the similarity score is high, there could be slight variations in the exact pattern of the wingtips which might not perfectly match the Ivory Gull's typical pattern.\"]",

The tail appears to be relatively short compared to the body, which is typical for many gull species. The texture of the tail feathers looks smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light in certain areas.
