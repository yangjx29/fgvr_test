The wings are large and broad, extending far beyond the body, which is characteristic of seabirds adapted for long-distance flight over water. The wingtips are pointed, enhancing aerodynamic efficiency. The overall shape of the wings is slightly concave, typical of birds designed for gliding and soaring. There are no visible markings or spots that would suggest it belongs to a specific species within a broader category like albatrosses or petrels.

Here's a detailed description focusing on the head and facial features:\n\n1. **Color**: The head is predominantly dark gray, with a slightly lighter shade around the eye area, giving it a subtle contrast. The coloration is smooth and lacks distinct patterns.\n\n2. **Texture**: The feathers appear soft and slightly glossy, typical of seabirds that spend much time in the water. There are no visible textures like downy plumage or roughness.\n\n3. **Shape and Size**: The head is small relative to the body, which is characteristic of many seabirds. It has a pointed beak that is slightly curved downward, which is a common feature among petrels for catching fish and squid.\n\n4. **Unique or Distinctive Features**:\n   - **Beak**: The beak is long, narrow, and slightly hooked at the tip, which is ideal for grasping slippery prey.\n   - **Eyes**: The eyes are dark and small, positioned towards the front of the head, allowing for better depth perception when diving for food.\n   - **Ears**: Petrels do not have external ear",
