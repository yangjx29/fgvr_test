This stripe is bordered by darker brown feathers above and below it. The beak is short and conical, typical of seed-eating birds, and is black in color.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head have a slightly rough texture, which is characteristic of larks. The eye ring is smooth and contrasts sharply with the surrounding feathers, making it a prominent feature.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The beak is short and robust, suitable for cracking seeds. It is slightly curved at the tip, aiding in picking up small seeds from the ground. The overall head shape is rounded, with a small, compact appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The eye ring is a key identifier for Horned Larks. It is a distinctive feature that helps distinguish them from other lark species. The combination of the light brown head, dark eye ring, and short, black beak is unique to this species.\n\n- **Variations**: While the described",
