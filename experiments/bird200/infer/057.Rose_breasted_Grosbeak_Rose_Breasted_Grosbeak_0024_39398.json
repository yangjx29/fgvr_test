The red patch is bordered by a thin white line, adding to the distinctiveness.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is rounded and small compared to the body, typical of many songbirds. The beak is short and conical, suitable for seed-eating.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the black head, red neck, and white border around the red patch is unique to this species.
