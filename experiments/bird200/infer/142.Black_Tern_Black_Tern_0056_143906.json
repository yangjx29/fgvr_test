The overall shape is compact and aerodynamic, suited for efficient flight.",

This darker hue is more pronounced at the tips, creating a subtle contrast.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, indicative of their health and well-being. There are no visible signs of fraying or damage.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wingtips are pointed and taper to a fine edge, which is characteristic of many seabirds. The tail feathers are also slender and pointed, with a slight upward curve at the tip, enhancing the streamlined look of the bird in flight.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The wingtips have a slight upward curve, which is a common feature in birds adapted for efficient flight over water. The tail feathers are relatively short and narrow, further aiding in maneuverability during flight.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The wingtips and tail feathers show a consistent pattern of dark gray, which helps in distinguishing them from lighter areas of the body. There are no visible markings or spots, making the wingtips and tail feathers uniform in color and shape.\n\nThese features collectively help identify the bird as a species adapted for aquatic",

The head is white with a dark cap and a black stripe extending from the eye to the back of the head, creating a mask-like appearance. The beak is short and pointed, with a dark coloration, and the legs and feet are not visible in the image.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is compact and elongated, typical of seabirds. Its wings are long and narrow, tapering to a sharp point at the tips, which is characteristic of terns. The tail is short and square-cut, aiding in maneuverability during flight.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap and the dark stripe on the head, which are diagnostic of many tern species. The bird's overall proportions suggest it is a smaller to medium-sized tern, likely a common tern (Sterna hirundo) or a similar species.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The bird's posture in flight indicates it is gliding"
