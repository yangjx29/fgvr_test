Here's a detailed description focusing on the wings and tail feathers:\n\n- **Color**: The wings and tail feathers are predominantly dark, almost black, with subtle hints of iridescent sheen, especially noticeable under certain light conditions. This dark coloration helps the bird blend into its aquatic environment, providing camouflage.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear dense and slightly glossy, which is typical for cormorants. They are not fluffy like those of ducks; instead, they are compact and tightly packed, aiding in water resistance and efficient swimming.\n\n- **Patterns**: There are no distinct patterns visible on the wings or tail feathers. The uniform dark coloration is consistent throughout, with slight variations in shading that may indicate wear or natural color variation.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are broad and rounded at the tips, which is characteristic of cormorants. They are relatively short compared to the body length, which is adapted for diving and maneuvering underwater. The tail feathers are short and rounded, contributing to the streamlined profile of the bird.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature of the wings and tail is their overall dark",

There are subtle variations in coloration, with lighter areas around the neck and darker tones towards the back.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a streamlined body shape, adapted for swimming, with a long, narrow bill that curves downward at the tip. Its wings are relatively short and broad, which is characteristic of diving birds like cormorants. The overall size seems moderate, neither too large nor too small for its species.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the bird's bill, which is long and slender with a hook at the end, used for catching fish. The eyes are large and dark, giving it an alert expression. The bird's posture, with its head held high and slightly tilted, suggests it might be scanning the water for prey.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The bird's body is partially submerged in the water, indicating it is likely engaged in hunting or resting after a dive.
