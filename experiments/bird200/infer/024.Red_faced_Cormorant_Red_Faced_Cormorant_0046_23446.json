This vibrant color contrasts sharply with the black feathers of the rest of the body.\n- **Texture**: The facial patch appears smooth and lacks any visible feathering, giving it a glossy appearance. The texture seems slightly raised compared to the surrounding feathers.\n- **Shape and Size**: The facial patch is oval-shaped, encompassing the eyes and extending down towards the neck. It is relatively small in proportion to the overall size of the bird but stands out prominently due to its vivid color.\n- **Unique Features**: The red facial patch is a unique feature that sets this bird apart from others. Its placement and vividness make it highly noticeable and distinctive.\n- **Variations or Special Characteristics**: There are no visible variations or additional markings within the facial patch itself.

Its head is adorned with a bright red patch around the eyes, which contrasts sharply with the black feathers. The beak is short and pointed, with a light-colored tip.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the back and wings. The red facial patch is smooth and lacks any visible pattern, making it a striking feature.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The cormorant's body is robust and compact, with a broad chest and relatively short legs. It has a streamlined shape, ideal for swimming. The wings are broad and rounded, which is typical for birds that spend much time in water.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the red facial patch, which is unique to certain species of cormorants. Additionally, the bird's posture suggests it might be nesting, as it appears to be sitting on eggs.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The cormorant's feet are webbed, aiding in swimming, and its eyes are positioned on the sides of its head, providing excellent peripheral vision.

This red area is smooth and lacks any fine details or patterns. The beak is short and pointed, with a pale yellowish base that transitions to a darker tip, adding another point of contrast against the black body.\n\nThe tail is relatively short and also black, blending seamlessly with the rest of the body. The wings are folded close to the body, showing a slight curve at the tips, which are also black. The legs and feet are not clearly visible in the image, but they appear to be dark, likely matching the overall coloration of the bird.\n\nThe nest itself is simple, composed of dry grass and twigs, and it is situated on a rocky surface covered with patches of moss and lichen.
