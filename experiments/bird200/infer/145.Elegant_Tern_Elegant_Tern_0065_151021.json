This stripe contrasts sharply with the black cap. The rest of the head and neck are white, creating a clean, sharp contrast against the black areas.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head appear smooth and glossy, reflecting light, which enhances the contrast between the black and white areas. There are no visible patterns other than the clear demarcation between the black and white regions.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is small relative to the body, which is typical for terns. It has a streamlined shape that is aerodynamic, aiding in flight. The beak is long, thin, and slightly curved downward at the tip, which is characteristic of terns and helps them catch fish.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap and the white stripe through the eye, which is unique among many bird species.

Its wings are primarily white with black-tipped feathers, creating a striking contrast. The tail is also white, and the beak is bright orange with a black tip.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and slightly glossy, especially noticeable on the white parts. The black cap and wing tips have a slightly darker, more textured appearance compared to the rest of the body.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The tern has a streamlined body typical of seabirds, designed for efficient flight. Its wings are long and narrow, tapering towards the tips, which are black. The tail is forked and extends beyond the wings when in flight. The overall size suggests it is a medium-sized bird, likely smaller than a seagull but larger than a gull.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the combination of the white body, black cap, and orange beak.
