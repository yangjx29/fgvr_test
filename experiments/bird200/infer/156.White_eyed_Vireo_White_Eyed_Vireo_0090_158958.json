This stripe is bordered by yellowish tones around the eye, giving it a striking contrast.\n   - **Body:** The upperparts, including the back and wings, are olive-green with subtle streaking. The underparts are a pale yellowish-white, which is more prominent on the throat and chest.\n   - **Tail:** The tail is short and square-shaped, with a slight upward curve at the tip.\n\n2. **Shape and Size:**\n   - The bird has a compact body with a small, pointed beak typical of insectivorous birds. Its overall size is relatively small, fitting within the typical range for vireos.\n\n3. **Unique or Distinctive Features:**\n   - The white eye stripe is a key identifying feature, as it is not present in all vireo species.\n   - The yellowish throat and chest",
