This pattern is consistent across the wing, providing excellent camouflage against tree bark and other natural backgrounds.\n\n### Tail Feathers:\n- **Color**: The tail feathers are dark brown with subtle lighter edges, giving them a slightly scalloped appearance.\n- **Shape**: The tail is relatively short and rounded, with a slight upward curve at the tip.\n- **Size**: The tail is proportionate to the body, neither too long nor too short, fitting well within the bird's overall silhouette.\n\n### Unique Features:\n- **Head**: The head has a light brown cap with a darker stripe extending from the eye to the back of the head, adding to the bird's cryptic appearance.\n- **Be",

Here's a detailed description focusing on the body plumage:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The bird's body is covered with a mix of brown, gray, and white feathers. The primary coloration is a mottled brown with darker streaks and spots, creating a camouflaged effect. The texture of the feathers seems soft and slightly fluffy, typical of song sparrows.\n\n- **Patterns**: The plumage exhibits a distinct pattern of streaking and spotting. The head has a lighter, more speckled appearance compared to the back and wings, which have a denser, darker pattern. The underparts are generally lighter, with some streaking visible on the flanks.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is small and compact, with a rounded body and a short, conical beak. Its wings are relatively short and broad, and the tail is short and square-tipped.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Song Sparrow has a pale supercilium (eyebrow stripe) that runs above the eye, which is a distinctive feature.
