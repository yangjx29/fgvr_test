Here's a detailed description focusing on the body and wings:\n\n- **Color**: The bird's body is predominantly dark, almost black, with a glossy sheen that reflects light, indicating wet feathers typical of cormorants. The wings also appear dark, blending seamlessly with the body.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers have a fine, slightly iridescent texture, which is common in water birds like cormorants. There are no visible patterns or markings on the body or wings, maintaining a uniform dark coloration.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a robust, streamlined body shape adapted for swimming. Its wings are broad and rounded at the tips, which are characteristic of cormorants. The wings are folded close to the body, suggesting the bird might be resting or preparing to take flight.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The most noticeable feature is the bird's head, which is adorned with a crest of dark feathers that stand upright, giving it a somewhat comical appearance. This crest is a distinctive trait of cormorants and helps in identification. The beak is short and pointed,",

Here are the details that can be observed:\n\n- **Color**: The bird has predominantly dark plumage with a glossy black appearance. It has a bright orange-yellow patch around its eye, which is a distinctive feature. The beak is short and pointed, with a dark coloration.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers appear smooth and well-groomed, with no visible patterns other than the glossy sheen typical of many seabirds. The rock surface is rough and textured, with a light grayish-white color, indicating it could be limestone or a similar material.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird's body is compact and streamlined, typical of seabirds adapted for diving. Its head is rounded with a small crest on top, adding to its unique appearance. The size relative to the rock suggests it is a medium-sized bird, possibly a cormorant or a similar species.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the bright orange-yellow eye ring, which is not common among birds and helps in distinguishing this species.
