The beak is relatively large compared to the bird's body, which is consistent with puffins' feeding habits.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black cap on the head, which is a hallmark of puffins.

            "The bird in the image appears to be a Horned Puffin (Fratercula corniculata), identifiable by its distinctive black and white plumage and the horn-like projection on its bill. Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The bird has a predominantly black back and wings with a white underside. The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, typical of puffins' feathers. The head is mostly white with a black cap, and there is a noticeable black stripe extending from the eye to the back of the head.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird is relatively small compared to larger seabirds like gulls. Its body is compact and rounded, with short legs and a thick, sturdy bill. The wings are broad and rounded, suitable for diving and swimming underwater.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most striking feature is the horn-like projection on the upper mandible of the bill, which is characteristic of the Horned Puffin. This projection is not present in other puffin species.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The coloration and pattern are consistent with the Horned Puffin species.
