The texture of the feathers is relatively smooth, with some subtle variations in coloration that suggest a slightly mottled pattern.\n\n2. **Wing Patterns**: The wings are broad and rounded at the tips, which is characteristic of Fulmars. The leading edge of the wings shows a slight darkening, possibly indicating wear or age. There are no distinct markings or bands on the wings that would suggest it is an Albatross.\n\n3. **Tail Shape**: The tail is short and square, another feature typical of Fulmars. It does not have the long, forked tail seen in many seabirds like gulls or terns.\n\n4. **Unique Features**: The Fulmar's head is small compared to its body, with a stout, slightly hooked beak that is yellowish in color.
