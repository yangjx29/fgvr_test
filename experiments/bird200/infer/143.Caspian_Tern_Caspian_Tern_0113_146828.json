The eye appears dark, possibly black, and is surrounded by a thin, dark ring, giving it a piercing look. The bird's wings are outstretched, revealing a light grayish-blue coloration on the upper parts, while the underparts appear lighter, almost white. The overall shape of the bird is streamlined, typical of a tern, with a slender body and long, narrow wings. The tail is not fully visible but seems to be short and rounded. These features collectively distinguish the bird as a type of tern, likely a Common Tern (Sterna hirundo), known for its striking contrast between the white head and black cap.",

The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light, which is typical for many seabirds. The wings are outstretched, showcasing their broad shape, which is characteristic of birds designed for efficient flight over water. The tail feathers are short and pointed, aiding in maneuverability.\n\nThe wings are large in proportion to the body, indicating a bird adapted for long-distance flying. The tail feathers are relatively small compared to the wings, which is common in many seabird species. The coloration of the wings and tail is consistent throughout, without any distinct patterns or markings, except for the slight blue-gray at the tips.\n\nThe bird's beak is orange with a black tip, adding a contrasting color to the otherwise white plumage. This coloration is unique and helps distinguish it from other similar-looking birds. The overall appearance of the wings and tail is streamlined, suggesting an adaptation for swift and agile flight.",
