The back and wings have a mottled pattern of darker brown and gray, which provides excellent camouflage against the background.\n\n2. **Shape and Size**: The beak is short and conical, typical of insectivorous birds, and is slightly curved at the tip. It is relatively small compared to the body size, which is characteristic of phoebes.\n\n3. **Unique Features**: The eye is dark and round, surrounded by a light gray ring, which contrasts with the darker head color. The tail is long and forked, a key feature of phoebes.\n\n4. **Special Characteristics**: The Say's Phoebe has a distinctive white wing patch visible when the bird is in flight, which is not clearly visible in this still image.
