The beak is short and pointed, with a dark coloration that matches the head, giving it a streamlined appearance. The beak's shape is typical for birds that feed by probing into water or mud, suggesting it might be a wading bird.\n\nThe eye is small and dark, which is common among many bird species, providing a contrast against the black plumage. There are no visible patterns or markings on the head, making it appear uniform in color. The overall size of the head relative to the body suggests a compact structure, which could be indicative of a smaller bird species.\n\nThe beak is relatively short compared to some other bird species, such as herons or egrets, which have longer, more slender beaks. This shorter beak could suggest a diet that involves catching prey in shallow water or on the ground rather than in deeper water or in flight.\n\nIn summary, the bird's head and beak are characterized by their dark color, smooth texture, and compact shape, which are distinctive features that help distinguish it from larger, more elongated-beaked birds.",

Here's a detailed description focusing on the wing patterns and tail shape:\n\n- **Color and Texture**: The bird has a predominantly black plumage with a glossy sheen, especially noticeable on the head and back. The wings have a subtle iridescence, appearing slightly lighter than the body, with a hint of grayish-blue near the tips. The tail is short and forked, with a dark coloration.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The wings are relatively long and pointed, tapering towards the tip. The tail is short and deeply forked, which is characteristic of terns. The overall size of the bird is small, typical of terns, with a compact body and a slender build.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Black Tern's most distinctive feature is its forked tail, which is clearly visible in the image. This is a key characteristic that helps differentiate it from other tern species. Additionally, the bird's legs are orange with dark bands around them, which can also aid in identification.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The Black Tern's plumage can vary slightly depending on the season and age of the bird.
