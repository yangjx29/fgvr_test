The eye stripe, which runs from the base of the bill through the eye to the back of the head, is also black, creating a sharp contrast against the bright yellow of the rest of the head. This black coloration is smooth and glossy, indicating a healthy and well-maintained plumage.\n\nThe size of the black cap and eye stripe is relatively small compared to the overall head size of the bird, but they are prominent and clearly defined. The shape is rounded at the top with a slight taper towards the back of the head. There are no visible patterns or additional markings within the black areas, making them stand out distinctly against the yellow background of the head.\n\nThis combination of a bright yellow head with a contrasting black cap and eye stripe is unique to certain species of warblers, such as the Wilson's Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla), which matches the appearance of the bird in the image. The black cap and eye stripe serve as a distinctive feature that helps distinguish this bird from other similar warbler species.",
