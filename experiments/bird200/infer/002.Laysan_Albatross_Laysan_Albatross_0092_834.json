Here's a breakdown of its visual characteristics:\n\n- **Color**: The beak is predominantly light orange, transitioning to a darker shade at the tip. This coloration is consistent across the beak, though there may be subtle variations in shading.\n\n- **Texture**: The beak appears smooth and slightly glossy, typical of albatrosses, which helps in reducing drag during flight.\n\n- **Shape**: The beak is long and slender, with a slight downward curve near the tip. This shape is adapted for catching fish and squid, which are the primary food sources for albatrosses.\n\n- **Size**: The beak is relatively large compared to the head, which is common among seabirds like albatrosses. It is proportionate to the body size of the bird.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the black stripe running along the upper part of the eye, which gives the bird its name \"Black-browed.\" This stripe is not visible in the image due to the angle, but it is a key identifying",
