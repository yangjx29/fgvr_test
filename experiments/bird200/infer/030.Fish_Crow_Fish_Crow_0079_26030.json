The head's shape is rounded at the top, tapering down to the beak, which is relatively short compared to some other bird species.

There are no visible color variations or patterns other than the natural sheen.\n\n- **Texture**: The feathers appear smooth and well-maintained, suggesting the bird is in good health. The texture is consistent across the body, with no noticeable variations.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The bird has a streamlined body with a robust build typical of crows. Its wings are broad and slightly rounded at the tips, which is characteristic of its species. The tail is long and forked, adding to its distinctive silhouette.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The bird's beak is short and pointed, which is a key feature of crows. It is slightly curved, aiding in its ability to crack nuts and other hard foods. The eyes are small and dark, giving it an intense gaze.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The wingspan is relatively large compared to the body, allowing for efficient flight.
