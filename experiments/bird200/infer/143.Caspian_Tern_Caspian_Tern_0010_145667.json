The texture appears smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light, indicating a healthy, possibly moist surface. The shape is long and slender, tapering to a point at the end, which is characteristic of terns and helps them catch fish efficiently. The size of the beak is proportionate to the bird's head, neither too large nor too small, maintaining balance with the overall body structure. There are no visible patterns or markings other than the color gradient from orange to black, making the beak a distinct and easily recognizable feature.",

They have a sharp, pointed shape, which is typical for many seabirds, aiding in flight efficiency. The texture seems smooth and slightly glossy, reflecting light, suggesting a healthy, well-maintained plumage. There are no visible patterns on the wingtips; they are uniformly colored. The size of the wingtips is proportionate to the overall wing span, which is consistent with the bird's body size. No unique or distinctive features are present on the wingtips themselves, as they blend seamlessly into the darker coloration of the wing feathers.",
