Here's a detailed description focusing on the head and neck area:\n\n- **Color**: The head is predominantly black with a white stripe running through the eye, creating a mask-like appearance. The neck is also black, contrasting sharply with the white underparts.\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The feathers on the head appear smooth and glossy, reflecting light, which enhances the contrast between the black and white areas. There are no visible patterns other than the distinct black-and-white coloration.\n- **Shape and Size**: The head is small and rounded, typical of terns, with a pointed beak that is slightly curved at the tip. The beak is orange with a black tip, adding another distinguishing feature.\n- **Unique Features**: The black cap and white face stripe are characteristic of the Common Tern. The orange legs and feet are another notable feature, providing a bright contrast against the darker plumage.\n\nThese features collectively help identify the bird as a Common Tern, distinguishing it from other tern species by its specific coloration and pattern.",

They are relatively small compared to the body, tapering to a fine point. The texture seems smooth and uniform, without any visible speckles or markings. There are no unique or distinctive features noted on the wingtips that set them apart from typical bird wingtips. The overall appearance is consistent with the bird's overall plumage, which is predominantly light gray with a white underside and a black cap on the head.",

They appear slightly rounded at the ends, giving them a soft, almost fan-like appearance. The texture seems smooth, consistent with the overall plumage of the bird. There are no distinct markings or patterns on the tail feathers; they maintain a uniform coloration throughout their length. The size of the tail feathers is proportionate to the rest of the bird's body, contributing to its streamlined profile. No special or unique features stand out in the tail feathers compared to other birds in similar categories."
