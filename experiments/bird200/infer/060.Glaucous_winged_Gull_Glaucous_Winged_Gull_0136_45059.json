The eye is not clearly visible due to the angle and lighting, but it appears to be a dark color, likely black or dark brown. The beak's size and shape suggest it is adapted for both hunting and feeding on various types of food, including fish and other small marine creatures.\n\nThe bird's legs are pinkish-gray, and they are thin and long, which is typical for gulls, allowing them to walk efficiently on sandy or rocky surfaces. The feet are webbed, which aids in swimming and walking on wet ground. Overall, the bird's head and beak are well-adapted for its environment and lifestyle as a coastal bird.",

The beak is yellow with a dark tip, which is also common among gulls. The overall shape of the bird is robust and streamlined, adapted for efficient flight over water. The head is rounded, and the eye is small and dark, giving it an alert appearance.\n\nThe distinctive feature here is the object in the bird's beak, which looks like a cluster of black, possibly organic material, possibly seaweed or marine debris.

The webbing between the toes is a lighter shade of pink, almost translucent, and the tips of the toes are slightly darker, possibly indicating wear or dirt accumulation. The overall shape of the legs is straight and sturdy, supporting the bird's weight as it stands on the sandy ground.",
