The texture appears fluffy and slightly wavy, consistent with the overall coat of the dog. The ears are medium-sized and stand upright, though they have a slight curve at the tips, which adds a touch of elegance. They are positioned symmetrically on either side of the head, framing the face nicely. There are no visible patterns or markings on the ears, making them uniform in color and texture. The ears are not overly large compared to the rest of the body, maintaining a balanced look that complements the dog's overall small stature.",

The eyes are dark, possibly black or very dark brown, which contrasts sharply with the lighter fur.\n- **Texture**: The fur appears soft and slightly wavy, giving it a fluffy appearance. The texture seems consistent across the body, though the fur may be slightly longer around the face and ears.\n- **Patterns**: There are no visible patterns other than the natural variation in fur color and texture.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a compact head shape with pointed, upright ears that stand out prominently. The eyes are large and round, adding to the dog's expressive look. The nose is black and appears slightly wet, indicating the dog might have been recently eating or drinking.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's mouth is slightly open, revealing a bit of its tongue, which adds a playful element to its expression. The overall size of the dog suggests it is a small breed, likely a terrier or a similar type.\n\nThese features collectively make the dog visually distinctive and easily identifiable as a small, fluffy, and friendly-looking canine.",

Its head is proportionally large compared to its body, with upright, pointed ears and a short muzzle. The body is rounded and well-proportioned, typical of breeds like West Highland White Terriers.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression is friendly and alert, with dark, expressive eyes and a slightly open mouth showing its tongue.
