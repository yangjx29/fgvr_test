The coloration is predominantly white with distinct black markings, including a large patch over one eye and a stripe running down the center of its face. The fur appears smooth and short, with some areas showing slight variations in texture, possibly due to natural shedding or grooming.\n\nThe ears are medium-sized, triangular, and stand upright, which is characteristic of many working breeds. The eyes are almond-shaped and alert, with a light brown hue that contrasts nicely against the white fur. The nose is black and prominent, adding to the dog's sturdy appearance. The overall facial structure is broad and powerful, with a slightly wrinkled forehead that contributes to a strong and determined expression. This combination of features sets it apart from more slender or finer-boned breeds, making it easily identifiable as a breed with a robust and athletic build.",

There are also smaller black spots scattered across the white fur, particularly noticeable on the shoulders and near the legs. The texture appears smooth and short-haired.\n\nThe dog's ears are floppy and slightly rounded at the tips, and they have a natural, relaxed appearance. Its eyes are a light color, possibly amber or hazel, and they are set within a white face that contrasts sharply with the black markings around them. The nose is black, and the mouth is slightly open, revealing a pink tongue and some teeth.\n\nThe dog's body is medium-sized, with a muscular build typical of breeds like the American Staffordshire Terrier or Pit Bull. The legs are strong and appear well-proportioned for the breed. The tail is short and curved upwards, with a white tip visible.\n\nOverall, the combination of the white coat with black markings, the shape of the ears, and the overall body structure make this dog visually distinctive and easily identifiable as a specific breed or type.",
