The fur appears soft and smooth, with some areas showing slight variations in texture, possibly indicating natural shedding or the presence of different hair lengths.

The brown fur is slightly darker than the white, providing a clear contrast.\n\nThe puppy's ears are floppy and have a mix of white and brown fur, with the brown being more prominent on the outer edges. The shape of the ears is rounded and droopy, typical of many breeds. The puppy's eyes are dark and expressive, adding to its adorable appearance. Its mouth is slightly open, revealing a pink tongue, which gives it a playful and happy expression.\n\nThe puppy's body is small and compact, with short legs and a sturdy build.
