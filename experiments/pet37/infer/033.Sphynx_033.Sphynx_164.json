The ears are large and pointed, standing upright, which is characteristic of the breed.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The most distinctive feature is the lack of fur, which allows for a clear view of the skin's texture and color. The cat's eyes appear dark, and its nose is pinkish, matching the overall coloration of its skin. The tail is long and slender, tapering towards the end.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The cat's posture is relaxed yet alert, with its front paws slightly apart and its back legs positioned firmly on the surface. This stance suggests a calm demeanor while",
