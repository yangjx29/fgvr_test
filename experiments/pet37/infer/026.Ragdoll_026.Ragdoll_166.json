The eyes are large and expressive, with a blue hue, adding to the cat's distinctive look.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The combination of the mask pattern, the upright ears, and the blue eyes makes this cat visually unique.

The contrast between the lighter body and darker extremities creates a classic \"pointed\" pattern characteristic of Siamese cats.\n\nThe cat's body is medium-sized, with a compact yet muscular build.

The fur around the eyes is darker, creating a mask-like appearance, which is a hallmark of the Siamese breed. The texture seems fine and silky, as expected for a Siamese cat.
