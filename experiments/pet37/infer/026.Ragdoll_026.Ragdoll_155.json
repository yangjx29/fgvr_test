They are proportionally large, which is a feature often associated with the Ragdoll breed.\n- **Unique Features**: There are no visible markings or patterns on the paws; they are uniformly white. The pads are not clearly visible due to the fur covering them, but they are likely a darker color, possibly pinkish or grayish, which is common in cats.\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: The paws are symmetrical and appear healthy, with no signs of injury or abnormality.
