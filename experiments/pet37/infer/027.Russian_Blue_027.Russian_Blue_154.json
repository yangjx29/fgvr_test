Its legs are medium-length, and it sits upright on the stack of books, suggesting a medium to large-sized cat.\n- **Unique Features**: The cat's ears are small and rounded, which is a distinctive trait of the Russian Blue. Its eyes are almond-shaped and have a slightly slanted appearance, adding to its unique look.\n- **Special Characteristics**: The cat's posture, sitting alertly on the books, showcases its confident and independent nature, which is often observed in this breed.\n\nThese features collectively distinguish the cat as a Russian Blue, setting it apart from other breeds with different colorations, textures, or body shapes.",

The tail is long and thick, extending horizontally across the stack of books it is perched upon. Its shape is robust and rounded at the base, tapering slightly towards the tip. The tail's length is substantial, reaching beyond the edge of the books and curving slightly downward. There are no unique or distinctive features such as tufts of fur or a bushy end; it maintains a consistent thickness throughout its length. This tail's characteristics suggest it could belong to a breed known for having a solid, muscular build, such as the Russian Blue, which often has a tail that is thick and well-muscled."
