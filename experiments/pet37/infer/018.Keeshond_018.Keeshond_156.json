The muzzle is short and broad, contributing to the dog's compact and sturdy appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The Pomeranian's face has a distinctive \"pom-pom\" look due to the dense fur around the head and neck. The ears are small and stand upright, adding to the breed's alert expression.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: Pomeranians often have a slight beard and mustache-like tufts of hair under their chin, which can be seen in this image.
