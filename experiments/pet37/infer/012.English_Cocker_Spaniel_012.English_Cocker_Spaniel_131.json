The similarity scores provided by the similarity search further support this classification, with the English Cocker Spaniel having the highest score among the candidates. | Key Features: ['Thick, slightly wavy black coat', 'Rounded head with a medium-sized snout', 'Floppy ears hanging close to the sides of the head', 'Dark, expressive eyes', 'Black nose', 'Closed mouth with a hint of a red collar'] | Uncertainty: ['While the similarity scores suggest a high likelihood of the dog being an English Cocker Spaniel, the absence of specific markings or patterns could potentially lead to slight confusion with other breeds like the Newfoundland.']",

The ears are floppy and hang down close to the sides of the head.\n- **Unique Features**:\n  - The eyes are dark and expressive, giving the dog an alert yet calm demeanor.\n  - The nose is black and prominent, contributing to the overall robust appearance.\n  - The mouth is closed, and there is a hint of a red collar around the neck, suggesting it might be a pet.\n\nThese features collectively suggest the dog could be a Cocker Spaniel or a similar breed known for their fluffy coats and friendly expressions.",

They are proportionally large compared to the dog's head, which is typical for breeds like the Cocker Spaniel. The ears are dark in color, matching the rest of the dog's coat, and there are no visible variations or special markings on them. The overall shape is rounded and droopy, contributing to the dog's gentle and friendly appearance.",

Here's a detailed description focusing on the body shape and size:\n\n- **Color**: The dog is predominantly black with a shiny, slightly wavy coat. There are no visible patterns or markings other than the natural color variation within the fur.\n- **Texture**: The fur appears thick and somewhat curly, giving it a fluffy appearance. This texture suggests a breed that might be known for its dense, water-repellent coat.\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog has a medium to large build, with a broad chest and a sturdy frame. Its head is proportionate to its body, with a broad skull and a slightly elongated snout. The ears are floppy and hang down close to the sides of the head.\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, and its nose is black. The overall body shape is robust and muscular, suggesting strength and agility.\n\nThese characteristics could indicate a breed such as a Cocker Spaniel, Labrador Retriever, or a similar medium to large-sized breed with a thick coat.
