The shaggy, long fur, the color pattern with a predominantly black coat and lighter brown accents on the chest and muzzle, and the overall size and build are consistent with the Wheaten Terrier breed. The facial structure, including the floppy ears, dark eyes, and prominent black nose, also aligns well with the Wheaten Terrier. The similarity score for Wheaten Terrier is higher than other candidates, further supporting this classification. | Key Features: ['Shaggy, long fur', 'Predominantly black coat with lighter brown accents', 'Floppy ears', 'Dark eyes and a prominent black nose'] | Uncertainty: ['The image does not provide a full-body view, which could affect the accuracy of the size assessment.', 'The similarity scores are close, making it challenging to definitively rule out other breeds.']",

            "The dog in the image has a predominantly black coat with lighter brown fur around its muzzle and chest. Its face is expressive, with a slightly open mouth showing its teeth, giving it an alert expression. The fur on its face is longer and more textured compared to the rest of its body, creating a shaggy appearance. The ears are floppy and hang down on either side of its head, adding to the overall fluffy look. The eyes are dark and appear to be looking directly at the camera, which adds to the dog's engaging demeanor. The fur around the eyes is darker, almost blending into the black coloration of the face, while the fur around the mouth is lighter, creating a contrast. The dog's nose is black and prominent, contributing to its overall facial features. The texture of the fur appears soft and slightly wavy, especially noticeable around the face and ears. This combination of color, texture, and pattern is characteristic of certain terrier breeds, though without more information, it's not possible to definitively identify the breed.",
            "The dog in the image appears to be a small breed with a compact and sturdy build. Here are the visual characteristics that help distinguish it:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a mix of dark brown and black fur on its back and head, with lighter brown fur on its chest and legs. The fur is somewhat shaggy and appears slightly unkempt, giving it a natural, untrimmed look.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur is thick and somewhat coarse, which is typical for breeds like Yorkshire Terriers (Yorkies). There are no distinct patterns, just a uniform coat coloration with some variation in shade.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog is small in stature, likely weighing less than 10 pounds. Its body is short and stocky, with a broad head and a relatively long tail that curls over its back. The ears are small and floppy, adding to the overall compact appearance.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's face is expressive, with a slightly scruffy beard and mustache-like fur around its mouth, which is characteristic of many terrier breeds. Its eyes are dark and alert, and its nose is black, contributing to its endearing expression.\n\n- **Special Characteristics**: The dog's fur is not neatly groomed,",
