They are relatively small in proportion to the head, which is typical for many small dog breeds.\n- **Unique Features**: The ears have a distinct triangular shape, with the tips pointing upwards. There is a slight variation in coloration where the inner part of the ear may have a slightly darker hue, possibly due to shadowing or natural pigmentation differences.\n\nThese features collectively help distinguish the ears as a unique aspect of the dog's breed, contributing to its overall appearance and character.",
