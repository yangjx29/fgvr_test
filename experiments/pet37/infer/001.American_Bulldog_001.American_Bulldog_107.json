Here's a detailed description of its facial features:\n\n- **Color**: The dog has a predominantly white coat with distinct black markings. The most prominent marking is a large, dark patch over one eye, which is characteristic of the breed. There are also smaller black spots scattered across the body.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The fur looks smooth and short, typical of Boxers. The black patches have a slightly darker, almost glossy texture compared to the white fur, which is smoother.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The snout is broad and short, a key feature of the Boxer breed. It is relatively small in proportion to the head, giving it a square-like appearance. The ears are medium-sized, triangular, and stand upright, though they may droop slightly at the tips.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's expression is alert and attentive, with wide, dark eyes that give it an expressive look. The black nose contrasts sharply with the white fur around it, making it a focal point.\n\n- **Variations/Characteristics**: Boxers often have a brindle pattern, which is not present here.
