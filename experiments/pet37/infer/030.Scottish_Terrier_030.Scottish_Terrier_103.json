The small size, shaggy white coat, and the distinctively upright and pointed ears are all typical of this breed.

The nose is black, and the mouth area appears slightly darker than the rest of the face, creating a subtle contrast.

Here’s a detailed description focusing on the dog's body posture, size relative to the surrounding objects, and distinctive features:\n\n- **Color, Texture, and Patterns**: The dog has a predominantly white coat with some darker markings around its eyes and muzzle, giving it a slightly darker facial area. Its fur appears soft and well-groomed, with a slightly shaggy texture. The rug beneath it has an intricate floral design with warm tones of beige, gold, and red, which contrasts nicely with the dog's white fur.\n\n- **Shape and Size Relative to the Object**: The dog is positioned in front of a glass coffee table with a brass frame. It is significantly smaller than the table, emphasizing its compact size. The dog's ears are upright and pointed, adding to its alert appearance. Its body is relatively short and stocky, typical of breeds like the West Highland White Terrier (Westie).\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's large, expressive eyes and perked-up ears make it appear attentive and curious. Its tail is short and curled over its back, a characteristic feature of the breed. The dog's size in relation to the table",

The dog's ears are upright and pointed, adding a distinctive feature to its face. Its eyes are dark and expressive, contrasting with the white fur. The dog is small in size, likely a breed such as a Scottish Terrier or a similar small terrier type, which is evident from its compact body and short legs.
