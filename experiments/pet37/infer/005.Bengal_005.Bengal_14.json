The rich, warm brown fur with distinct tabby patterns, including swirling bands and stripes, is a hallmark of the Bengal breed.

The overall appearance, including the fur texture and the facial structure, aligns closely with the Bengal breed.

The eyes are large relative to the head, adding to the cat's expressive appearance.\n\n2. **Whiskers**: The whiskers are prominent and well-defined, extending outward from the sides of the mouth. They are white and appear slightly curved, providing a stark contrast against the cat's fur. The whiskers are long and fine, contributing to the cat's overall alert and attentive expression.\n\n3. **Color and Texture**: The cat's fur is a rich golden-brown color with darker brown stripes, creating a tabby pattern. The texture appears smooth and glossy, suggesting a healthy coat. The fur around the eyes is slightly lighter, blending into the golden hue of the rest of the face.\n\n4. **Shape and Size**: The cat's ears are pointed and upright, indicating attentiveness.
