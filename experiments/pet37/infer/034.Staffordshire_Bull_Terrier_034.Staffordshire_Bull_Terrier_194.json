Its head is broad with a short muzzle, and the ears are small and folded over. The overall shape is square and sturdy, characteristic of the breed.\n\n- **Unique or Distinctive Features**: The dog's expression is calm yet alert, with a focused gaze. Its ears are not floppy but rather stand upright, adding to its alert appearance.
