The light beige coat with a slightly darker shade around the eyes and muzzle is typical of the breed. The fluffy, wavy fur, rounded face, and expressive eyes are also consistent with the Wheaten Terrier. The long, floppy ears blend into the fur, and the overall size and shape of the head align with the breed standards. While the similarity scores suggest other breeds like Havanese and Pomeranian could be close matches, the specific combination of coat texture, facial structure, and coloration strongly points towards a Wheaten Terrier. | Key Features: Light beige coat, wavy fur, rounded face, expressive eyes, long floppy ears, and a slightly darker shade around the eyes and muzzle. | Uncertainty: The similarity scores to Havanese and Pomeranian are relatively high, indicating some visual overlap.

            "The dog in the image has a thick, fluffy coat with a predominantly light beige or cream color. The fur appears soft and slightly wavy, giving it a textured appearance. There is a noticeable gradient in the coat's color, with the fur around the face being lighter and more white, while the body fur transitions into a slightly darker shade of beige.\n\nThe coat's texture is dense and voluminous, contributing to the dog's overall fluffy look. The fur around the face is particularly prominent, framing the dog's expressive eyes and adding to its endearing expression. The ears are covered in long, soft fur that hangs down, enhancing the dog's gentle demeanor.\n\nUnique features include the dog's wide, open mouth with a pink tongue visible, suggesting a happy or relaxed state. The fur around the mouth area is slightly darker than the rest of the face, creating a subtle contrast. The dog is wearing a collar with a metal clasp and leash attachment, which adds a functional element to the visual composition.\n\nIn summary, the dog's coat is characterized by its soft, fluffy texture, light beige coloration, and a gentle gradient effect. These features, combined with the dog's relaxed expression and the functional collar, make it distinct within the category of dogs.",
