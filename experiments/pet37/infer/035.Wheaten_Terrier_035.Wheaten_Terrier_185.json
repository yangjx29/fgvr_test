The fur around the face is denser and more pronounced.\n\n- **Texture**: The fur is thick, soft, and wavy, giving it a fluffy appearance. This texture is characteristic of Lhasa Apsos and helps them retain warmth.\n\n- **Patterns**: The fur around the face is darker, almost black, creating a mask-like pattern that contrasts with the lighter fur on the rest of the body.
