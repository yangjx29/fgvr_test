The light golden-brown coat with darker shades around the face and ears is typical of the breed. The soft, slightly wavy fur and floppy ears are also indicative of a Wheaten Terrier. Additionally, the size relative to the object it's interacting with suggests a proportionate body size, which aligns with the breed standards. The similarity scores provided by the search also indicate a high likelihood of the dog being a Wheaten Terrier, with a score of 0.2940, which is higher than other breeds listed. | Key Features: Light golden-brown coat with darker shades around the face and ears, soft and slightly wavy fur, floppy ears, broad and square facial structure, and proportionate body size. | Uncertainty: While the visual evidence strongly supports the Wheaten Terrier classification, there could be slight variations in coat color and texture that might lead to minor uncertainty.

The dog's head is close to the camera, obscuring much of its body and tail, which are not fully visible.\n\nThe dog is interacting with a small, dark blue and yellow object, possibly a toy or a piece of clothing. The object has a distinct shape, being rectangular and padded, with a yellow border around the edges. It contrasts with the dog's fur due to its darker color and smoother texture.\n\nNo significant variations or special characteristics are apparent in the visible parts of the dog's body or tail.

The toy has a black body with yellow accents on the top and bottom edges.\n\n- **Texture and Patterns**: The dog's fur appears soft and slightly shaggy, typical of breeds like Shih Tzus or Soft Coated Wheaten Terriers. The toy fabric looks smooth and possibly synthetic, with a solid color scheme.\n\n- **Shape and Size**: The dog's paws are large compared to its body, which is characteristic of certain breeds. The paws are rounded and appear sturdy. The toy is small enough to fit comfortably in the dog's mouth, suggesting it is designed as a chew toy.\n\n- **Unique Features**: The dog's paws have distinct pads visible at the bottom, which are typically darker than the fur above them. The toy has a simple design with no intricate patterns, making it easy to identify as a chew toy rather than a stuffed animal.\n\n- **Variations and Special Characteristics**: The dog's legs are proportionate to its body, and the paws are well-developed, indicating"
