The coat color is predominantly light brown, which matches the Wheaten Terrier's typical wheaten color. The medium build, muscular yet balanced physique, and the slightly curved upward tail are also consistent with the breed. The facial structure, including the broad and square face, dark eyes, and black nose, aligns well with the Wheaten Terrier's appearance. Additionally, the open mouth with a pink tongue and white teeth suggests a happy and healthy dog, which is common in the breed. | Key Features: ['Light brown coat with a glossy sheen', 'Medium build with a muscular yet balanced physique', 'Slightly curved upward tail', 'Broad and square facial structure', 'Dark eyes and black nose'] | Uncertainty: [\"The similarity scores suggest some overlap with other breeds, but the Wheaten Terrier's distinct coat color and facial structure provide strong evidence for this classification.\"]",

The mouth is open, revealing a pink tongue and white teeth, suggesting the dog might be panting or smiling. The overall shape of the face is broad and square, typical of many mixed-breed dogs. The ears' position and the dog's overall facial structure contribute to a friendly and approachable appearance.",

Its coat is a rich golden-brown color, with a slightly darker shade on the back and lighter tones on the chest and inner legs. The fur appears smooth and well-groomed, with no visible patterns other than natural color variation.\n\nThe dog's head is proportionate to its body, with a broad forehead and a medium-sized, pointed snout. Its ears are triangular and stand erect, adding to its alert appearance. The eyes are dark and expressive, contributing to an attentive demeanor. The tail is bushy and curled over the back, indicating a healthy and active dog.\n\nThe dog's size appears to be that of a medium-sized breed, neither too large nor too small for its breed type. It stands comfortably on all fours, suggesting good bone structure and muscle tone. There are no visible abnormalities or unique markings that set it apart from typical dogs of this size and build.",

The dog's overall posture is upright and attentive, suggesting it is comfortable and possibly playful.\n\nThe dog's coat is a rich, warm brown with a glossy sheen, and there are no visible patterns or markings that stand out. The ears are medium-sized, triangular, and slightly floppy, adding to the dog's friendly appearance. The dog's eyes are dark and expressive, contributing to an overall impression of intelligence and alertness. The dog's mouth is open, revealing a pink tongue and white teeth, which could indicate panting or a happy expression.\n\nThe dog's body is compact and muscular, with a sturdy build. The legs are proportionate to the body, and the paws appear to be well-formed and healthy. The dog's overall appearance suggests it could be a mixed breed, possibly with traits from breeds like a terrier or a hound, given the combination of physical characteristics such as the tail shape, ear structure, and body type."
