Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.48, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.

torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 37.60 GiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 47.40 GiB of which 9.96 GiB is free. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 37.44 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 36.68 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 461.82 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
